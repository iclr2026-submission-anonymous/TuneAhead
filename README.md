## ðŸ“Š Data

We release a randomly sampled subset of the meta-dataset under `data/`.  
All subsets are stored in **CSV format** and can be directly consumed by the training and evaluation scripts.

Full-scale datasets and private ETL pipelines are **not included** due to license/privacy constraints and ongoing research.  

All interfaces remain identical, so replacing the subset CSVs with full datasets will work without modification.

## ðŸ›  Feature Extraction

Code for feature extraction is under `features/`:

- `extract_static.py`: computes dataset-intrinsic descriptors (e.g., lexical diversity, token length statistics, duplication rate).  
- `extract_dynamic.py`: runs fixed-budget probe fine-tunes to capture early dynamics (e.g., loss decay, gradient stability).  

Both modules output CSV files that match the input format expected by `train.py`.

## ðŸš€ Training & Evaluation

```bash
# Train predictor
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml

# Evaluate predictor
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/model.pkl
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization

Visualization scripts are under `plots/`:

- Grid plots of predicted vs. true accuracy  
- SHAP feature attribution plots  
- Calibration and isotonic regression curves  

Run, for example:

```bash
python plots/plot_grid.py --input results/predictions.csv
```

## ðŸ“œ License & Notes

- Full-scale meta-datasets are **not released** due to license/privacy constraints and because they remain part of ongoing research.  
- All released code is anonymized and stripped of sensitive components for ICLR review.
