The World Bank is the collective name for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA), two of five international organizations owned by the World Bank Group. It was established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. After a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947. In the 1970s, it focused on loans to developing world countries, shifting away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30 years, it has included NGOs and environmental groups in its loan portfolio. Its loan strategy is influenced by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, as well as environmental and social safeguards.\n\nAs of 2022, the World Bank is run by a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice presidents. IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively. The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and the U.K. have the most voting power. The bank aims loans at developing countries to help reduce poverty. The bank is engaged in several global partnerships and initiatives, and takes a role in working toward addressing climate change. The World Bank operates a number of training wings and it works with the Clean Air Initiative and the UN Development Business. It works within the Open Data Initiative and hosts an Open Knowledge Repository.\n\nThe World Bank has been criticized as promoting inflation and harming economic development, causing protests in 1988 and 2000. There has also been criticism of the bank's governance and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n问题: From the passage note down the name of the countries which have most voting power.

This can lead to much frustration and the need to learn more about electrical systems than one may wish. First, a solar controller is needed for all solar-powered systems. Solar controllers regulate the incoming energy, and limit the amount of watts a system can support. Many solar panels come with a solar controller built in, but if you have a system pre-wired with existing solar panels that you are trying to add to there is likely already a solar controller. Adding an additional controller will prevent the new panel from working. If one does not know about solar controllers it can be very difficult to figure out, and may lead to angry overnight Amazon shipments of multimeters to determine what is breaking. However, multiple solar controllers is not the only potential problem. Different solar panel manufacturers have different cord types and connector types, and even within a type of connector there is the idea of “polarity” - the direction a connector needs to be plugged in. This can also lead to internet research, frustration, and more overnight Amazon orders of polarity switching adaptors. If one is especially unlucky it will rain all day once all parts finally arrive, delaying testing of the system."

        "content": "背景: In 2009, Garrett Camp, a co-founder of StumbleUpon, came up with the idea to create Uber to make it easier and cheaper to procure direct transportation. Camp and Travis Kalanick had spent $800 hiring a private driver on New Year's Eve, which they deemed excessive, and Camp was also inspired by his difficulty in finding a taxi on a snowy night in Paris. The prototype of the mobile app was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick as the \"mega advisor\" to the company.\n\nIn February 2010, Ryan Graves became the first Uber employee; he was named chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2010. In December 2010, Kalanick succeeded Graves as CEO and Graves became the chief operating officer.\n\nFollowing a beta launch in May 2010, Uber's services and mobile app launched publicly in San Francisco in 2011. Originally, the application only allowed users to hail a black luxury car and the price was approximately 1.5 times that of a taxi. In 2011, the company changed its name from UberCab to Uber after complaints from San Francisco taxicab operators.\n\nThe company's early hires included a nuclear physicist, a computational neuroscientist, and a machinery expert who worked on predicting arrival times for Uber's cars more accurately than Google APIs. In April 2012, Uber launched a service in Chicago, whereby users were able to request a regular taxi or an Uber driver via its mobile app.\n\nIn July 2012, the company introduced UberX, a cheaper option that allowed drivers to use non-luxury vehicles, including their personal vehicles, subject to a background check, insurance, registration, and vehicle standards. By December 2013, the service was operating in 65 cities.\n\nIn December 2013, USA Today named Uber its tech company of the year.\n\nIn August 2014, Uber launched a shared transport service in the San Francisco Bay Area and launched Uber Eats, a food delivery service.\n\n\nUber logo used from February 2016 until September 2018\nIn August 2016, facing tough competition, Uber sold its operations in China to DiDi in exchange for an 18% stake in DiDi. DiDi agreed to invest $1 billion in Uber. Uber had started operations in China in 2014, under the name 优步 (Yōubù).\n\nIn 2016, Uber acquired Ottomotto, a self-driving truck company founded by Anthony Levandowski, for $625 million. Levandowski, previously employed by Waymo, allegedly founded Ottomotto using trade secrets he stole from Waymo. Uber settled a lawsuit regarding the use of such intellectual property and reached a deal to use Waymo's technology for its freight transport operations.\n\nIn December 2016, Uber acquired Geometric Intelligence. Geometric Intelligence's 15 person staff formed the initial core of \"Uber AI\", a division for researching AI technologies and machine learning. Uber AI created multiple open source projects, such as Pyro, Ludwig, and Plato. Uber AI also developed new AI techniques and algorithms, such as the POET algorithm and a sequence of papers on neuroevolution. Uber AI was shut down in May 2020.\n\nIn August 2017, Dara Khosrowshahi, the former CEO of Expedia Group, replaced Kalanick as CEO.\n\nIn February 2018, Uber combined its operations in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan with those of Yandex.Taxi and invested $225 million in the venture. In March 2018, Uber merged its services in Southeast Asia with those of Grab in exchange for a 27.5% ownership stake in Grab.\n\nBetween May 2018 and November 2018, Uber offered Uber Rent powered by Getaround, a peer-to-peer carsharing service available to some users in San Francisco.\n\nIn November 2018, Uber became a gold member of the Linux Foundation.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, Uber became a public company via an initial public offering.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Uber announced layoffs of 8% of its staff and eliminated the position of COO Barney Harford.\n\nIn October 2019, in partnership with HeliFlight, Uber offered 8-minute helicopter flights between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport for $200-$225 per passenger.\n\nBetween October 2019 and May 2020, Uber offered Uber Works, a mobile app connecting workers who wanted temporary jobs with businesses in Chicago and Miami.\n\nIn January 2020, Uber acquired Careem for $3.1 billion and sold its Indian Uber Eats operations to Zomato.\n\nAlso in January 2020, Uber tested a feature that enabled drivers at the Santa Barbara, Sacramento, and Palm Springs airports to set fares based on a multiple of Uber's rates.\n\nIn May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Uber announced layoffs of over 14% of its workforce.\n\nIn June 2020, in its first software as a service partnership, Uber announced that it would manage the on-demand high-occupancy vehicle fleet for Marin Transit, a public bus agency in Marin County, California.\n\nIn July 2020, Uber, in partnership with its majority-owned Cornershop, launched Uber grocery delivery service in Latin America, Canada, Miami, and Dallas.\n\nIn September 2020, Uber committed to carbon neutrality globally by 2040, and required that, by 2030, in most countries, rides must be offered exclusively in electric vehicles.\n\nIn December 2020, Uber acquired Postmates for $2.65 billion.\n\nAlso in December 2020, Uber sold its Elevate division, which was developing short flights using VTOL aircraft, to Joby Aviation.\n\nIn January 2021, Uber ATG/Advanced Technologies Group, a joint venture minority-owned by SoftBank Vision Fund, Toyota, and Denso that was developing self-driving cars, was sold to Aurora Innovation for $4 billion in equity and Uber invested $400 million into Aurora.\n\nIn March 2021, the company moved to a new headquarters on Third Street in Mission Bay, San Francisco, consisting of several 6- and 11-story buildings connected by bridges and walkways.\n\nIn October 2021, Uber acquired Drizly, an alcohol delivery service, for $1.1 billion in cash and stock.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, Uber acquired Australian car-sharing company Car Next Door.\n\nIn May 2022, Uber began operations in Italy, forming a partnership with IT Taxi, Italy's largest taxi dispatcher, to integrate the dispatcher's drivers with the Uber platform. Uber had previously done similar deals in Spain, Germany, Austria, Turkey, South Korea, Hong Kong, and New York.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, Uber discovered a security breach of its internal network by a hacker that utilized social engineering to obtain an employee's credentials and gain access to the company's VPN and intranet. The company said that no sensitive data had been compromised\n\n问题: Given a reference text about Uber, tell me when the old CEO was replaced."

First turn on MFA (Multiple Factor Authentication) everywhere for all your accounts work (must be turned on if your employer takes security seriously) and personal accounts. Second NEVER reuse passwords, instead use a Password Manager. There are several for instance Google Chrome browser provides a password manager out of the box. Same if you use Apple products (iOS, Safari web browser, etc.). There are also commercial password managers such as 1Password and LastPass. Third never click or open URL links that look suspicious or from unknown senders. Fourth use a digital key like a Yubikey. The YubiKey is an easy to use extra layer of security for your online accounts. A single YubiKey has multiple functions for securing your login to email, online services, apps, computers, and even physical spaces. These are some basic steps that will protect your digital identity. Finally ALWAYS use a Lockscreen for your desktop computer, laptop, etc. All your devices should always auto lock after 3-5 minutes of inactivity. These basic steps provide a solid foundation so you will never be hacked."

        "content": "The primary reason why iPhones are more popular inside the United States than outside the United States is cost. Because many companies manufacture and sell Android phones, the cost of an Android phone is low. On the other hand, Apple is the only company that sells iPhones, and this lack of competition allows Apple to charge a higher price. The United States has the highest per capita household income of any country in the world, thus people in the United States are more able to afford iPhones than are people outside the United States. A secondary reason for iPhone’s relative popularity in the United States is cultural: an iPhone is seen as a sort of status symbol, and some iPhone features only work with other iPhones, thus some people feel they will be “missing out” socially if they have an Android phone instead of an iPhone."

Rudra (left) is represented in Vedic literature, is shown as Shiva-Rudra 2nd-century sculpture (middle), and as Shiva (meaning kind) in 13th-century art work (right). The iconography evolved, retaining some symbolic elements such as trident, axe or antelope.The most referred to Devas in the Rigveda are Indra, Agni (fire) and Soma, with \"fire deity\" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a yajna fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra (later given the exclusive epithet of Shiva), and Prajapati (later Brahma) are gods and hence Devas.The Vedas describes a number of significant Devis such as Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the Rigveda. Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BCE to 200 CE), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Brahman, the Supreme power.\n\n问题: Who are the  most referred to Devas in the Rigveda as per the passage?"

Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, which can lead to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, increases prices for consumers, and lowers wages for employees.\n\nMany industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nMost countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies.\n\nIt is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role. With post-socialist economies, oligopolies may be particularly pronounced. For example in Armenia, where business elites enjoy oligopoly, 19% of the whole economy is monopolized (BEEPS 2009 database), making it the most monopolized country in the region. \n\n问题: What is an oligopoly?"

Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed. The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.\n\n问题: When did Singapore gain independence, and who was the first President?"

However you will likely find that you will need to bring additional water and drink options to ensure proper hydrations, especially on very long flights. Entertainment:  You want to make sure that your children can engage in plenty of activities on long flights.

        "content": "To raise a grand slam trophy, a player has to win 7 consecutive best of 5 set matches and in all likelihood against several top 10 players. Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents. Such massive support staff carry a lot of payroll that most unseeded players cannot afford. For this reason, though at times we see a qualifier make it through to later stages of a slam, they will rarely ever get past quarter finals let alone win a grand slam."

This would require speaking to the business users to understand the as-is process, going through existing BRD and process flow documents to understand as-is structure. Regular 1:1 with key business stakeholders does help. BA also needs to establish relationship with the IT team, after all its them who will be implementing the BRD BA documents.

Here are our top reasons to live in the beautiful state of Arizona. \n\n \n\n1. Great Places to Live\n \n\nOne popular benefit of living in Arizona is the relatively low cost of living.\n\n \n\nFamilies are moving to Arizona for affordable housing and a better quality of life. Here are some of our favorite cities.\n\n \n\nPhoenix\n \n\nNicknamed the \"Valley of the Sun,\" Phoenix is a bustling city with a great combination of a thriving job market, affordable living, and many ways to enjoy the outdoors.\n\n \n\nPhoenix has it all. From professional sports to amazing eateries to great shopping districts, there's so much to do in Phoenix. \n\n \n\nIt's a popular spot for young professionals, families, and retirees too. It's home to Arizona State University, dozens of museums, and endless outdoor adventures. And people are flocking to Phoenix, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the country.\n\n \n\nLitchfield Park\n \n\nThis beautiful city is located 16 miles from downtown Phoenix and is known for the gorgeous palms and orange trees that line the major streets. Families are attracted to the beautiful homes, great schools, and low crime rate in Litchfield Park.\n\n \n\nWith a quaint small-town feel, residents can walk or ride their bikes to more than 20 special events and festivals the town hosts each year. Some amenities include walking paths, six parks, baseball and soccer fields, and first-class golf courses.\n\n \n\nCasa Grande\n \n\nCasa Grande is the largest city in Pinal County. It's a beautiful modern city with a rich cultural heritage. Casa Grande is a designated Enterprise Zone with jobs in many industries and a diverse, vibrant population.\n\n \n\nAffordable homes, great weather, beautiful parks, and unique shopping opportunities help make Casa Grande a great place to live or raise a family.\n\n \n\nGoodyear\n \n\nGoodyear is one of the top 20 fastest growing cities in the country. The job market here is thriving with companies like REI, Amazon, and many others drawn to the city's forward thinking and motivated workforce.\n\n \n\nLocated 17 miles west of Phoenix, Goodyear is close to the action of the city yet has a warm community feel. Lovely homes, high-performing schools, a low crime rate, and easy access to great shopping and entertainment make Goodyear a wonderful place to call home.\n\n \n\nQueen Creek\n \n\nThis suburb of Phoenix in Maricopa County is the perfect place to live and play in Arizona. Friendly residents, a rural feel, and great schools make Queen Creek a popular moving destination for families.\n\n \n\nSome amenities include beautiful parks, horseback riding trails, museums, and farm tours. A mix of luxury and affordable homes plus the gorgeous outdoor scenery help make Queen Creek a great place to live, work, and play.\n\n \n\n2. Strong Job Market\n \n\nPeople move from all over the country to Arizona for job opportunities. The job growth rate in Arizona is double the national average.\n\n \n\nThe state government is the largest employer in the state. And the largest private employer is Banner Health, which is based in Phoenix.\n\n \n\nJob opportunities in Arizona's many industries are plentiful. Top employment sectors include financial services, transportation, travel and tourism, utilities, technology, education, healthcare, and hospitality.\n\n \n\nIf you're looking for a job, Arizona has something for you.\n\n \n\n3. Sunny Climate\n \n\nIf you like it hot, you'll love Arizona. They have an average of 320 sunny days each year. Phoenix, the state capital, has more sunny days than any other large city in the country.\n\n \n\nIf you're sick of the snow and long cold winters, Arizona may be for you. Many people find the hot, dry climate beneficial for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), seasonal allergies, arthritis, asthma, and other health conditions.\n\n \n\nYou'll want to protect yourself from the sun's rays in Arizona. Temperatures can escalate at times to well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. So, you need to use sunscreen, stay hydrated, and stay indoors when it gets too hot to venture out.\n\n \n\n4. The Grand Canyon\n \n\nPeople come from around the world to see this natural wonder. If you want to hike, explore, or camp in one of the most majestic spots on earth, you'll love the Grand Canyon.\n\n \n\nOver 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon each year to take in the breathtaking scenery. The canyon is 227 miles long, 18 miles wide, and a mile deep.\n\n \n\nBe sure to check out Grand Canyon National Park to enjoy hiking, fishing, cycling, boating, horseback riding, and many other outdoor activities. If you haven't seen it before, it's worth the time to step into nature, explore, and take in all the amazing sights.\n\n \n\n5. Cultural Attractions\n \n\nArizona is home to a variety of football, baseball, hockey and basketball teams, including the Cardinals, Suns, Coyotes and Diamondbacks. Children's sports programs are thriving in the state, and soccer programs are growing in popularity.\n\n \n\nThere are several noteworthy museums for visiting, including the Heard Center, the Phoenix Art Museum and the Artistic Photography Center. You can find many open-air venues in the state due to the consistent warm weather.\n\n \n\nWhether you're in the mood for a rock concert, opera, ballet, symphony or a little gambling, there's always something to do.\n\n \n\nThere are also fantastic resorts, family restaurants, fine dining and bars to enjoy. There's something for everyone in Arizona.\n\n \n\n6. Amazing Sunsets\n \n\nYou can't find anything more beautiful than an Arizona sunset. Almost every night the sky is ablaze with gorgeous shades of red, yellow, and orange across the horizon.\n\n \n\nWhether you're taking a walk, driving home from work, or gazing into the sunset, you can't help noticing these amazing sunsets and drinking in the beauty of Arizona's sparse yet unique desert landscape.\n\n \n\nIf you haven't watched the sunset while hiking the Grand Canyon, it's an experience you don't want to miss.\n\n \n\n7. Beautiful Sedona\n \n\nAlong with the Grand Canyon, add Sedona to your to-do list. It's about 100 miles south of the canyon.\n\n \n\nSedona is famous for its beauty, mild climate, and diverse artistic community. You can explore the red-rock buttes, canyons, and various hiking trails.\n\n \n\nTake a hot air balloon ride if you're feeling adventurous and enjoy the amazing views of the desert, steep canyon walls, and red-rock formations.\n\n \n\n8. Forget Daylight Savings Time\n \n\nWhen you live in Arizona, you don't have to worry about setting the clock back or forward for daylight savings time.\n\n \n\nIn Arizona, the residents never think about it because it doesn't exist. So, no more arriving an hour early or late for work because you forgot to set the clock.\n\n \n\nArizona has so much to offer. And this is just one more small reason to love Arizona.\n\n \n\n9. Retirees' Paradise\n \n\nRetirees are flocking to Arizona for its great weather, affordable housing, and low taxes. There's no tax on social security and public pensions qualify for a tax deduction. \n\n \n\nArizona has plenty of affordable housing and retirement communities for seniors, and property taxes are lower than the national average. There's no sales tax on groceries, which is another big plus.\n\n \n\nThere's plenty to keep active seniors busy, like local sporting events, the great outdoors and top-rated golf courses.\n\n \n\nThese are just a few of the benefits of living in Arizona. It's is a great place to visit and an even better place to call home."

        "content": "背景: Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\n\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\n\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day. The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947, though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983–84. Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players. Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season. Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\n\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3 pm Eastern Time. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\n\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.\n\n问题: Summarize the main milestones of an NBA season"

Look for vegan products where you can, such as vegan cheeses and vegan ice cream, which can be delicious."

        "content": "背景: From 1901 to 1912, the committee, headed by the conservative Carl David af Wirsén, weighed the literary quality of a work against its contribution towards humanity's struggle 'toward the ideal'. Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors little read today.\n\nThe first prize in 1901, awarded to the French poet Sully Prudhomme, was heavily criticised. Many believed that the acclaimed Russian author Tolstoy should have been awarded the first Nobel prize in literature.\n\nThe choice of philosopher Rudolf Eucken as Nobel laureate in 1908 is widely considered to be one of the worst mistakes in the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The main candidates for the prize that year were poet Algernon Swinburne and author Selma Lagerlöf, but the Academy were divided between the candidates and, as a compromise, Eucken, representative of the Academy's interpretation of Nobel's \"ideal direction\", was launched as an alternative candidate that could be agreed upon.\n\nThe choice of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf as Nobel laureate in 1909 (for the \"lofty idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception that characterizes her writings\") followed fierce debate because of her writing style and subject matter, which broke literary decorums of the time.\n\nDuring World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries. The pacifistic author Romain Rolland was awarded the prize for 1915. Other years during the war Scandinavian writers were favoured, or the award was postponed.\n\nIn 1931 the prize was awarded posthumously to the poet and former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who had died earlier that year. The prize was controversial not just because it was the first and only time the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously, but because the Academy had previously awarded two other Swedish writers of the same literary era, Selma Lagerlöf in 1909 and Verner von Heidenstam in 1916. Internationally it was heavily criticised as few had heard of Karlfeldt.\n\nThe Nobel Prize awarded to Pearl Buck in 1938 is one of the most criticised in the history of the prize. The Academy awarded Buck \"for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces\", referring to acclaimed and popular books published only a few years earlier. But her later work is generally not considered to be of the literary standard of a Nobel laureate.\n\nJohn Steinbeck received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. The selection was heavily criticised, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", adding, \"we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\".\n\nIn 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he wrote declining it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize laureate. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\" Nevertheless he was awarded the prize.\n\nSoviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize laureate, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat—clandestine form). After the Swedish government refused to honour Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were \"an insult to the Nobel Prize itself.\" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union. Within the Swedish Academy, member Artur Lundkvist had argued that the Nobel Prize in Literature should not become a political prize and questioned the artistic value of Solzhenitsyn's work.\n\nIn 1974, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were believed to be likely candidates for the prize but the Academy decided on a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both members of the Swedish Academy at the time, and unknown outside their home country. Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976; neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded it.\n\n问题: Extract all the authors named in this paragraph on the controversies about Nobel laureate selections"

Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a \"black box\" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based."

Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles (electric cars and trucks), battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and is, as of 2023, the world's most valuable automaker. In 2021, the company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 21% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 14% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids). Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2021.\n\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, and the Tesla Semi truck in 2022. The company plans to start production of the Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023. The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. Tesla's 2022 full year deliveries were around 1.31 million vehicles, a 40% increase over the previous year, and cumulative sales totaled 3 million cars as of August 2022. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.\n\nTesla has been the subject of several lawsuits, government scrutiny, journalistic criticism, and public controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and defects with their products.\n\n问题: From the passage list down the various models of Tesla vehicle.

Key team metrics include the team's win percentage with the individual as the starting quarterback and the number of conference and nation championships won. A quarterback that excels at passing the football and running the football is commonly referred to as a \"dual threat\" quarterback.

Users can also ride content from RGT thanks to Wahoo’s acquisition of the company.  Wahoo system is aimed at what is defined as “time crunched athletes, and uses a 4 dimensional power profile, rather than the FTP (Functional Threshold Power) that other systems use.\n\nZwift is one of the oldest virtual cycling system, and is based on a social experience that allows riders to communicate with others nearby, do group rides, workouts and Races.  Zwift was not the first to introduce many of the virtual riding concepts, but the platform gained thousands of users during the covid-19 pandemic, and capitalised on the professional esports arena as well.\n\nZwift uses a more game-like graphical system, with multiple worlds that users can ride, with a monthly calendar changing the available worlds to ride it.  Zwit also has a comprehensive workout catalog.\n\nRouvy is a cycling platform that contains many of the features already mentioned, but it uses real world videos, with rider avatars superimposed over the top (Augmented Reality).  This gives you the feeling of actually riding the location you have selected, while seeing your vital statistics in the heads-up display.\n\nBKool is another software company offering many of the features that have been described in Zwift and Rouvy.  \n\nFulGaz is a newer platform that offers real video riding in high definition, and allows riders to upload their own videos to the community.\n\nIf you are looking for a riding app that allows you to ride and meet other people, group ride and just enjoy your time on the bike, then Zwift is a good choice to make.  If you are looking for some serious training, with detailed fitness reporting, the Wahoo systems would make a lot of sense.  If you want some serious training, but also want the experience of riding in real locations around the world, the Rouvy is the one to try. \n\nEach system requires a subscription to ride."

The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). \nThe series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin, Dudley. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of 11, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.\nHarry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life."

Then dig out a second blade length into the soil and set this portion to the side as well. Put the first portion back into the hole you've dug and then place the second portion on the top. By following this method, you can exchange the subsoil and topsoil. Alternatively, you can build a raised garden bed using wood or other material you have hand like corrugated metal. A raised garden bed should have sides that are about 1 - 3 feet high although you can vary this based on your needs. Fill the garden bed with soil mix from your local garden store or from other areas of your yard. Once the garden bed is filled, you can begin planting. Finally, you can use a sheet mulching method to start a garden bed in your backyard. Take thick cardboard or several sheets of a heavy paper material and lay it down on top of a grassy area in your backyard. You want to make sure that the cardboard or paper is overlapped so that it blocks all light to soil and grass underneath it. Once you have finished laying down your material to block the light, spread compost on top so it is three to six inches deep. You can plant into this compost layer. As a final layer, place one to three inches of mulch or straw on top to protect your compost layer."

        "content": "背景: Bangladesh is the second largest economy in South Asia after India. The country has outpaced India (of which it was a part until 1947) and Pakistan (of which it was a part until 1971) in terms of per capita income. According to the World Bank, \"When the newly independent country of Bangladesh was born on December 16, 1971, it was the second poorest country in the world—making the country's transformation over the next 50 years one of the great development stories. Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed. Enrolment in primary school is now nearly universal. Hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce. Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health. And the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by climate change and natural disasters. Bangladesh's success comprises many moving parts—from investing in human capital to establishing macroeconomic stability. Building on this success, the country is now setting the stage for further economic growth and job creation by ramping up investments in energy, inland connectivity, urban projects, and transport infrastructure, as well as prioritizing climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness on its path toward sustainable growth\".\n\nAfter the partition of India, the region underwent a change in economic geography. In East Pakistan, free market principles were generally accepted. The government promoted industrialization to produce consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. Certain sectors, like public utilities, fell under state ownership. Demand for jute during the Korean War led to the creation of the Adamjee Jute Mills, which replaced jute mills in Dundee and Calcutta as the largest jute mill in the world. However, by the 1960s, East Pakistan's share of exports fell from 70% to 50% as West Pakistan received the major portion of investments. Economic grievances played a key role in the pro-independence aspirations of East Pakistanis. During the initial five years of independence (1971-1975), newly created Bangladesh followed a socialist economy. In the late 1970s, socialist policies were largely reversed, industrial plants were returned to private owners, and private industry was increasingly promoted. The government set up export processing zones to stimulate the export economy. Between 1991 and 1993, finance minister Saifur Rahman launched further reforms with support from the IMF which liberalized the economy and boosted industrial growth, services, and exports. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the reform momentum lost steam due to chronic political instability, but the economy continued to grow.\n\nIn 2022, Bangladesh had the second largest foreign-exchange reserves in South Asia. The reserves have boosted the government's spending capacity in spite of tax revenues forming only 7.7% of government revenue. A big chunk of investments have gone into the power sector. In 2009, Bangladesh was experiencing daily blackouts several times a day. In 2022, the country achieved 100% electrification. One of the major anti-poverty schemes of the Bangladeshi government is the Ashrayan Project which aims to eradicate homelessness by providing free housing. The poverty rate has gone down from 80% in 1971, to 44.2% in 1991, to 12.9% in 2021. The literacy rate stood at 74.66% in 2022. Bangladesh has a labor force of roughly 70 million, which is the world's seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.2% as of 2021. The government is setting up 100 special economic zones to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and generate 10 million jobs. The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) have been established to help investors in setting up factories; and to complement the longstanding Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA). The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency. The service sector accounts for about 51.3% of total GDP and employs 39% of the workforce. The industrial sector accounts for 35.1% of GDP and employs 20.4% of the workforce. The agriculture sector makes up 13.6% of the economy but is the biggest employment sector, with 40.6% of the workforce. In agriculture, the country is a major producer of rice, fish, tea, fruits, vegetables, flowers, and jute. Lobsters and shrimps are some of Bangladesh's well known exports.\n\n问题: Please list the key points about Bangladesh economy from the paragraph below:"

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."

Just before President Adams left office he appointed new justices of the peace for Washington D.C., Jefferson, the next President refused to deliver the commissions.  This led to the case Marbury vs Madison.  The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.  Both decisions would reduce the Supreme Court's legitimacy. John Marshall side-stepped this problem by striking down the Judiciary Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This was the establishment of judicial review, a Supreme Court power that was only hinted at in the Constitution."

Following these successes Hurgon became the director at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London where, when Paul Rubens was indisposed due to ill health while working on Miss Hook of Holland, Hurgon quickly replaced him and finished writing the book and directed the play. Miss Hook was another success, and he moved on to direct My Mimosa Maid (1908) for Curzon. However, The Three Kisses (1907) at the Apollo Theatre and My Mimosa Maid failed, and his association with Curzon ended, his management having lasted for just four performances of the latter piece. Next Hurgon directed The Hon'ble Phil (1908) and Kitty Grey (1909) with music by Talbot at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York. For C. H. Workman he took over the management of and directed the failing musical Two Merry Monarchs (1910) at the Strand Theatre, the last piece that can be considered a Savoy opera.\n\n问题: With this paragraph on Austen Hurgon's biography, what movies did he direct before My Mimosa Maid?"

The resolution of binary integers increases exponentially as the word length increases. Adding one bit doubles the resolution, adding two quadruples it and so on.

Houseplants are kept in containers that can retain water which can lead to root rot if not watered carefully. Some houseplants prefer the soil to dry out between waterings and many home gardeners end up watering before the soil has dried up sufficiently. Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times. Other reasons include too little sunlight which limits the plants ability to photosynthesize. Also, even too much sunlight can cause burned leaves."

The syndrome is no longer recognised as a diagnosis in itself, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were merged into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that 'treatment' of any form of autism should not be a goal, since autism is not 'a disease that can be removed or cured'. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, 'management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world'. The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood, but social and communication difficulties usually persist.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome\n\n问题: Given these paragraphs about Asperger syndrome, after whom it was named?"

Here are some steps to follow to help you swim in the ocean:\n\nChoose a Safe Location: Before entering the water, make sure you choose a safe location to swim. Look for a spot that's away from strong currents, riptides, and waves. Avoid swimming alone, and make sure there are other people around in case you need help.\n\nCheck the Conditions: Before entering the water, check the weather and ocean conditions. Avoid swimming if there are strong winds, high waves, or thunderstorms. If there are lifeguards on duty, ask them about the current conditions and any potential hazards.\n\nWear Proper Gear: Make sure you wear proper swimwear, such as a wetsuit or rash guard, to protect your skin from the sun and ocean elements. Consider wearing fins or a snorkel to help you swim more efficiently.\n\nPractice Good Swimming Technique: When swimming in the ocean, use good swimming technique to help conserve your energy. Avoid swimming against the current, and swim parallel to the shore if you need to move sideways. Use a slow, steady stroke to conserve energy.\n\nBe Aware of Marine Life: When swimming in the ocean, be aware of any marine life that may be in the water. Avoid swimming near schools of fish, and stay away from jellyfish and other potentially dangerous creatures. If you do encounter a shark or other predator, stay calm and swim away slowly.\n\nFollow Ocean Safety Rules: Finally, follow any ocean safety rules that are in place. For example, some beaches may have specific areas designated for swimming, while others may require you to wear a life jacket or avoid swimming during certain times of day.\n\nBy following these steps, you can enjoy a safe and enjoyable swimming experience in the ocean. Remember to stay aware of your surroundings, practice good swimming technique, and take proper safety precautions to ensure that you stay safe."

He is known colloquially as El Libertador, or the Liberator of America.\n\nSimón Bolívar was born in Caracas in the Captaincy General of Venezuela into a wealthy family of American-born Spaniards (criollo), but lost both parents as a child. Bolívar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bolívar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bolívar returned to Venezuela and proposed gaining Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bolívar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.\n\nBolívar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bolívar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bolívar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre Pétion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bolívar received military support from Pétion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bolívar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bolívar as president there and in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIn his final years, Bolívar became increasingly disillusioned with the South American republics, and distanced from them because of his centralist ideology. He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture."

It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential. In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation.\n\nA consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy."

Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as \"conventional\" or \"traditional\" dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying. Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.\nDried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits.

Along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, Singapore is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has surpassed its peers in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.\n\nThe Singaporean economy is regarded as free, innovative, dynamic and business-friendly. For several years, Singapore has been one of the few countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the only Asian country to achieve this rating. Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption. It is the world's most competitive economy in 2019, according to the World Economic Forum's ranking of 141 countries, with the 2nd highest GDP per capita. Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans. Despite market freedom, Singapore's government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing 22% of the GDP. The city is a popular location for conferences and events.\n\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It has been interchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967. MAS manages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy. Singapore has the world's eleventh largest foreign reserves, and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.\n\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based income and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore. In 2009, Singapore was removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens, and ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's off-shore financial service providers, banking one-eighth of the world's offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities\". In August 2016, The Straits Times reported that Indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near Singapore to bring Indonesian capital back into the tax base. In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank's banking licence for their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund scandal.\n\n\nPanoramic view of the Central Business District\nSingapore has the world's highest percentage of millionaires, with one out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in disposable wealth. This excludes property, businesses, and luxury goods, which if included would increase the number of millionaires, especially as property in Singapore is among the world's most expensive. In 2016, Singapore was rated the world's most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and this remained true in 2018. The government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute poverty is rare. Some of the programmes include providing between S$400 and S$1000 of financial assistance per month to needy households, providing free medical care at government hospitals, and paying for children's tuition. Other benefits include compensation for gym fees to encourage citizens to exercise, up to S$166,000 as a baby bonus for each citizen, heavily subsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reduced-cost laptops for poor students, rebates for costs such as public transport and utility bills, and more. As of 2018 Singapore's ranking in the Human Development Index is 9th in the world, with an HDI value of 0.935.\n\n问题: Is Singapore a good place to develop wealth?"

        "content": "背景: The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.  If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.\n\n问题: What do the terms direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) mean?"

Bacardi 151 was sold in the United States and Canada from at least 1963 until 2016, when its production was discontinued.\n\nSafety and lawsuits\nBecause of its high alcohol content, Bacardi 151 was particularly flammable among liquors. For this reason it was often used as the ignition source for \"flaming shots\" and even for at-home pyrotechnic stunts. The bottle carried a warning label advising consumers, among other things, \"do not use this product for flaming dishes or other drinks.\" Bottles were also equipped with a stainless steel flame arrester crimped onto the neck of the bottle to prevent the rum inside the bottle from igniting. Nevertheless, Bacardi faced at least two lawsuits from consumers who claimed to have been badly injured by the product's flames.

In September 2007, dehydrated tardigrades were taken into low Earth orbit on the FOTON-M3 mission carrying the BIOPAN astrobiology payload. For 10 days, groups of tardigrades, some of them previously dehydrated, some of them not, were exposed to the hard vacuum of outer space, or vacuum and solar UV radiation. Back on Earth, more than 68% of the subjects protected from solar UV radiation were reanimated within 30 minutes following rehydration, although subsequent mortality was high; many of these produced viable embryos. In contrast, hydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar UV radiation had significantly reduced survival, with only three subjects of Milnesium tardigradum surviving. Also, it was found that the space vacuum did not have a significant effect on egg-laying in either R. coronifer or M. tardigradum. However, M. tardigradum exposed to UV radiation had a lower egg laying rate. In May 2011, Italian scientists sent tardigrades on board the International Space Station along with extremophiles on STS-134, the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour. Their conclusion was that microgravity and cosmic radiation \"did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight, and stated that tardigrades represent a useful animal for space research.\" In November 2011, they were among the organisms to be sent by the U.S.-based Planetary Society on the Russian Fobos-Grunt mission's Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment to Phobos; however, the launch failed. In August 2019, scientists reported that a capsule containing tardigrades in a cryptobiotic state may have survived for a while on the Moon after the April 2019 crash landing of Beresheet, a failed Israeli lunar lander, but in May 2021 it was reported that they were unlikely to have survived the impact.\n\n问题: Based on this paragraph on Tardigrades when did we first send them to space?"

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists.

Humanists believe in the innate goodness of human beings, the inherent capacity of humans to care about each other, and it stresses the rational in explaining the world around us.  It is a belief system for those who cannot embrace the supernatural and prefer instead to reside in the actual world and try to understand it with scientific explanations. Humanists use facts, reasoning, and empathy to make decisions. Some others call Humanism 'Good without god'. Humanists aren't openly hostile or antagonistic towards organized religions, but instead they respect that everyone has the right to their own beliefs."

His father, Thomas John Farley Sr. (1936–99), owned an oil company, and his mother, Mary Anne (née Crosby), was a homemaker. He had four siblings: Tom Jr., Kevin, John, and Barbara. His cousin, Jim, is chief executive officer at Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe Farleys are Irish Catholics. Chris attended parochial schools in Madison, including Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart. According to Joel Murray, a fellow Second City cast member, Chris would \"always make it to Mass.\"\n\nMany of his summers were spent as a camper and counselor at Red Arrow Camp, near Minocqua, Wisconsin. He graduated from Marquette University in 1986, with a double major in communications and theater. At Marquette, he played rugby union and discovered a love of comedy.\n\nAfter college, he worked with his father at the Scotch Oil Company in Madison. He first learned the art of improvisational comedy at the Ark Improv Theatre in Madison.\n\nFarley made his way to Chicago, performing first at Improv Olympic. He then attended Chicago's Second City Theatre, starting the same day as Stephen Colbert, initially as part of Second City's touring group. He was eventually promoted to their main stage in 1989, and was a cast member of three revues, The Gods Must Be Lazy, It Was Thirty Years Ago Today, and Flag Smoking Permitted in Lobby Only or Censorama.\n\n问题: Please extract the names of each of the Second City Theatre venues in which Chris Farley was a cast member, separated by commas."

In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded the Exobiology Program, now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded Project Cyclops, part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System.

In March 1948, this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries, forming the Brussels Treaty Organization, commonly known as the Western Union. Talks for a wider military alliance, which could include North America, also began that month in the United States, where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression, such as the February 1948 coup d'état in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty.\n\nA long rectangular room with multiple rows of seated individuals on each side, and flags hanging at the far end.\nWest Germany joined NATO in 1955, which led to the formation of the rival Warsaw Pact during the Cold War.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in 1951, which adopted many of the Western Union's military structures and plans, including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952, the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organization's chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises, Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization. Following the London and Paris Conferences, West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily, as they joined NATO in May 1955, which was, in turn, a major factor in the creation of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.\n\nThe building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions, when 400,000 US troops were stationed in Europe. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion – doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966. In 1982, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.\n\nThe Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent. In October 1990, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance, and in November 1990, the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December, which removed the de facto main adversaries of NATO. This began a draw-down of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52,000 pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years, and allowed military spending by NATO's European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015. In 1990 assurances were given by several Western leaders to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east, as revealed by memoranda of private conversations. However, the final text of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, signed later that year, contained no mention of the issue of eastward expansion.\n\nTwo tall concrete sections of a wall in a grass lawn in front of a curved building with blue-glass windows.\nThe Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked a turning point in NATO's role in Europe, and this section of the wall is now displayed outside NATO headquarters.\nIn the 1990s, the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns. During the Breakup of Yugoslavia, the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. These conflicts motivated a major post-Cold War military restructuring. NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established.\n\nPolitically, the organization sought better relations with the newly autonomous Central and Eastern European states, and diplomatic forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up during this post-Cold War period, including the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative in 1994, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997, and the NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council in 1998. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO, and the organization also issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\". These plans governed the subsequent addition of new alliance members. The election of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 led to a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.\n\nArticle 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations, and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1973.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by all NATO members, and was one of the seven times that Article 4, which calls for consultation among NATO members, has been invoked. Prior times included during the Iraq War and Syrian Civil War. At the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time to spend the equivalent of at least two percent of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024, which had previously been only an informal guideline. At the 2016 Warsaw summit, NATO countries agreed on the creation of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, which deployed four multinational battalion-sized battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Before and during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several NATO countries sent ground troops, warships and fighter aircraft to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank, and multiple countries again invoked Article 4. In March 2022, NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders. NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, and elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATO's history.\n\nAs of June 2022, NATO had deployed 40,000 troops along its 2,500-kilometre-long (1,550 mi) Eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. More than half of this number have been deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, which five countries muster a considerable combined ex-NATO force of 259,000 troops.

Its members in 1949 were the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. On 18 February 1952, Greece and Turkey also joined.\n\nWhen West Germany joined the organization on 9 May 1955 it was described as \"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Minister of Norway at the time., the result was the Warsaw Pact, signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states as response to NATO.\n\nAfter the Cold War in 1999 three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland joined NATO. On 29 March 2004 seven more Northern European and Eastern European countries joined NATO: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and also Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania.\n\nCroatia and Albania received NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008. The Republic of Macedonia received the only conditional invitation because it was vetoed by Greece because of its name dispute with Greece.\n\nMontenegro joined on 5 June 2017.  Having changed its name to end the dispute, North Macedonia joined NATO on 27 March 2020 and became its 30th member. Ireland officially joined NATO on 8 September 2020 as an observer.\n\nIn April 2023, Finland joined NATO, following efforts to join since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine."

        "content": "背景: By 1936 the company felt justified in constructing a large new manufacturing facility in Seamer Road, Scarborough. This allowed increased production, and Plaxtons became popular with many independent operators throughout Northern England. Many of these operators purchased their vehicles through independent dealers, rather than directly from the factory. In this regard, Plaxton's sales were through Lancashire Motor Traders Ltd of Manchester and Arlington Motor Co Ltd of London. The company became known as FW Plaxton & Son by 1937, as the founder's son, also named Frederick William joined the company at the age of 18. FW Plaxton junior was to be known as Eric to avoid confusion with his father.\n\nPlaxtons built a number of different coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally from the bottom of the front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the \"bullnose\" radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.\n\nOn the outbreak of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory was turned into a munitions factory under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some adjacent land was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later.\n\n问题: When and why was the plaxton coach production halted?"

If a baby is well fed and well rested, babies could have gas or burp as other secondary reasons for crying. Babies also need appropriate clothing as per weather or room temperature. Lastly babies also tend to get bored and need constant attention and someone to play with them. If the baby continues to cry despite all your efforts, please do not lose your patience, stay calm and contact your friends or neighbors for help. You can also reach out to your Pediatrician to check the baby for any other medical conditions. As a baby grows older, their duration and frequency of crying reduces."

        "content": "If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!"

It would be interesting to see how Fury is able to limit the body damage caused by Mike by using his world-renowned reflexes. \n\nI must still say that it would be a very close fight as both of them are greats of the boxing world!"

Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.

On 15 February 1942, the British surrendered to Japan and Singapore was renamed to Syonan-to. During the Japanese occupation, over 2500 lives were executed and many suffered hardships.\n\nPost World War II, Singapore operated as a self-government led by Lee Kuan Yew, reducing its reliance on the British. During 1963 to 1965, Singapore had a merger with neighbouring country Malayisa. However, the merger brought about many disagreement, tensions and unrest. Eventually, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became a fully independent country on 9 August 1965."

After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."

It begins the observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.\n\nOne theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day. Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then through American influence Halloween had spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nPopular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some people practice the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.\n\n问题: Based on the reference text, please provide a short bulleted list of 4 popular Halloween activities."

In addition, students learn to take care of creatures such as hippogriffs and unicorns in the Care of Magical Creatures class at Hogwarts. Rowling has also written Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a guide to the magical beasts found in the series, and based on the fictional textbook of the same name written by Newt Scamander and used by students at Hogwarts.\nSome creatures in the series are ordinary animals that may be imbued with magical properties or possess certain magical abilities. Owls, for example, deliver mail and have the ability to find the recipient regardless of their location. Other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, toads, rats and mice do not necessarily have magical abilities."

A majority of uncontacted peoples live in South America, particularly northern Brazil, where the Brazilian government and National Geographic estimate between 77 and 84 tribes reside.\n\nKnowledge of uncontacted peoples comes mostly from encounters with neighbouring indigenous communities and aerial footage.\n\n问题: What are Uncontacted peoples?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Uncontacted peoples generally refers to indigenous peoples who have remained largely isolated to the present day, maintaining their traditional lifestyles and functioning mostly independently from any political or governmental entities. However, European exploration and colonization during the early modern period brought indigenous peoples worldwide into contact with colonial settlers and explorers. As such, most indigenous groups have had some form of contact with other peoples. The term \"uncontacted\" therefore refers to a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-indigenous society at the present time.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights refers to uncontacted peoples as \"indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation.\" These groups are defined by their general rejection of contact with anyone outside of their own people. This definition also includes groups who have previously had sustained contact with the majority non-indigenous society but have chosen to return to isolation and no longer maintain contact. As such uncontacted peoples are understood not as living in an anachronistic state of nature but rather as contemporaries of modernity.\n\nA 2009 United Nations report also classified \"peoples in initial contact\" as sharing the same characteristics but beginning to regularly communicate with and integrate into mainstream society.\n\nTo highlight their agency in staying uncontacted or isolated, international organizations emphasize calling them \"indigenous peoples in isolation\" or \"in voluntary isolation\". Otherwise they have also been called \"hidden peoples\" or \"uncontacted tribes\".\n\nHistorically European colonial ideas of uncontacted peoples, and their colonial claims over them, were informed by the imagination of and search for Prester John, king of a wealthy Christian realm in isolation, as well as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying uncontacted peoples as \"lost tribes\".\n\nInternational organizations have highlighted the importance of protecting indigenous peoples' environment and lands, the importance of protecting them from exploitation or abuse, and the importance of no contact in order to prevent the spread of modern diseases.\n\nHistoric exploitation and abuse at the hands of the majority group have led many governments to give uncontacted people their lands and legal protection. Many indigenous groups live on national forests or protected grounds, such as the Vale do Javari in Brazil or the North Sentinel Island in India.\n\nMuch of the contention over uncontacted peoples has stemmed from governments' desire to extract natural resources. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brazil's federal government attempted to assimilate and integrate native groups living in the Amazon jungle in order to use their lands for farming. Their efforts were met with mixed success and criticism until, in 1987, Brazil created the Department of Isolated Indians inside of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio), Brazil's Indian Agency. FUNAI was successful in securing protected lands which have allowed certain groups to remain relatively uncontacted until the present day.\n\nA different outcome occurred in Colombia when the Nukak tribe of indigenous people was contacted by an evangelical group. The tribe was receptive to trade and eventually moved in order to have closer contact with settlers. This led to an outbreak of respiratory infections, violent clashes with narco-traffickers, and the death of hundreds of the Nukak, more than half of the tribe. Eventually, the Colombian government forcibly relocated the tribe to a nearby town where they received food and government support but were reported as living in poverty.\n\nThe threats to the Nukak tribe are generally shared by all peoples in isolation, particularly the outside world's desire to exploit their lands. This can include lumbering, ranching and farming, land speculation, oil prospecting and mining, and poaching. For example, then Peruvian President Alan García claimed in 2007 that uncontacted groups were only a \"fabrication of environmentalists bent on halting oil and gas exploration\". As recently as 2016, a Chinese subsidiary mining company in Bolivia ignored signs that they were encroaching on uncontacted tribes, and attempted to cover it up. In addition to commercial pursuits, other people such as missionaries can inadvertently cause great damage.\n\nIt was those threats, combined with attacks on their tribe by illegal cocaine traffickers, that led a group of Acre Indians to make contact with a village in Brazil and subsequently with the federal government in 2014. This behaviour suggests that many tribes are aware of the outside world and choose not to make contact unless motivated by fear or self-interest. Satellite images suggest that some tribes intentionally migrate away from roads or logging operations in order to remain secluded.\n\nIndigenous rights activists have often advocated that indigenous peoples in isolation be left alone, saying that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination as peoples. On the other hand, experience in Brazil suggests isolating peoples might want to have trading relationships and positive social connections with others, but choose isolation out of fear of conflict or exploitation. The Brazilian state organization National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) in collaboration with anthropological experts has chosen to make controlled initial contact with tribes. The organization operates 15 trading posts throughout protected territory where tribes can trade for metal tools and cooking instruments. The organization also steps in to prevent some conflicts and deliver vaccinations. However, FUNAI has been critical of political will in Brazil, reporting that it only received 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, after consensus among field agents, FUNAI released videos and images of several tribes under their protection. Although the decision was criticized, the director of the Isolated Indian department, Bruno Pereira, responded that \"The more the public knows and the more debate around the issue, the greater the chance of protecting isolated Indians and their lands\". He shared that the organization has been facing mounting political pressure to open up lands to commercial companies. He also justified the photography by explaining that FUNAI was investigating a possible massacre against the Flechieros tribe.\n\nRecognizing the myriad problems with contact, the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2009 and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2013 introduced guidelines and recommendations that included a right to choose self-isolation.\n\nThere have been reports of human safaris in India's Andaman Islands and in Peru, where tourism companies attempt to help tourists see uncontacted or recently contacted peoples. This practice is controversial."

Start by talking about topics that you are most comfortable and familiar with, like yourself!

Try to pay attention to the areas of improvement next time when you speak. Be mindful whenever you speak."

        "content": "背景: Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.\n\nWidely referred to as Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.\n\n\nExpansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million. Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least 2024. From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end. The capacity of the Emirates now stands at 60,704.\n\n问题: Give me a json array containing Arsenal stadiums and the year that they moved in based on the passage provided."

Purchase a whole packer brisket with both the point and flat muscle included. Prime grade brisket is ideal as it will have more fat marbling, which means more flavor and juiciness. However, choice grade will work fine for most cooks. Plan on 1/2 lb per person.\n\n2. Trim your brisket to remove and hard pieces of fat that will not render in the cooking process. I recommend leaving about 1/4 inch of fat on the point side, and trim off all fat off the flat. Note: the brisket trimming make great fat to mix into burgers!\n\n3. Texas brisket is seasoned only with coarse salt and coarse black pepper. I prefer a 50/50 mix. There are MANY brisket rubs available if you are looking to spice up your brisket from the traditional Texas salt and pepper rub.\n\n4. Use a good quality hardwood lump charcoal in your smoker. I use oak as a base wood with a little bit of hickory mixed in. You can use any smoker that can maintain a consistent temperature of 225-250 degrees. I prefer the Big Green Egg, but there are great smokers available from Weber, Traeger, CampChef and many more.\n\n5. Smoke the brisket at 225 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 165-170 degrees. I then remove the brisket, wrap in butcher paper, and return to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 202 degrees.\n\n6. When the brisket reaches 202 degrees, remove from the smoker and REST. DO NOT SKIP THE REST. Resting the brisket allows those hot and bubbly juices to settle into the meat. I prefer resting my brisket in a cooler covered in towels for 2 hours, but can rest as long as 4 hours before serving.\n\n7. When you are ready to serve, I separate the two pieces, flat and point.Slice the flat against the grain for maximum tenderness. Cube the point for burnt ends.\n\n8. Serve and enjoy!"

Also, we wanted to be clear about the firm’s north star, which is improved customer experience, efficient and reliable operations with low cost, and minimal environmental impact. \n\nUber’s business model: \n\nValue proposition:  \n\nUber’s value prop is to offer transportation services via internet orderings from the customer. Customers order a transportation service via a mobile-enabled app and get instant or real-time updates about the order status. This significantly differs from the current taxi-cab model, where customers must hire a taxi-cab by waiting in line at the airport or taxi station. The existing taxi hire model has a poor experience for customers and comes with a high cost. \n\nActivities, resources, and capabilities: \n\nThe critical activity for Uber in this business model is to connect the passengers and drivers on a demand basis concerning a location with a computer algorithm and deliver the service over a mobile app for both drivers and passengers. \n\nUber needs computational resources and engineers to build the algorithm. Also, Uber needs to develop capabilities to attract drivers and passengers to its platform for each market, country, and city. \n\nRevenue model: \n\nIn this model, Uber customers will pay per hire, which will include the transportation charge, driver’s labor fees, and the driver’s car maintenance, including fuel and running and maintenance expenses of the car, and a small commission for Uber that will be the revenue for the company. On average per ride, Uber expects to earn a 3% commission for basic taxi-hire service. Top-of-the-line services like Uber-X may earn up to 10% commission. \n\nScope of the enterprise: \n\nThis business model's primary customer segment is millennials with smartphones with internet-enabled services. \n\n \n\nThis business model's horizontal scope can be vastly expanded to different products. Uber can start with a standard taxi-hire service, and for the luxury segment, it can offer Uber-X and Uber-SUV. Uber can also branch to adjacent industries like food delivery with Uber Eats and freight delivery with Uber Freight. \n\n \n\nThe business’s sheer scope is to develop the in-house demand algorithm for connecting drivers and passengers. Uber does not intend to employ drivers. Instead, it will lease/contract the drivers on a per-ride basis and pay the contract cost to the drivers. In contrast, the computational and other IT infrastructure services will be leased/rented on services like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. This will enable Uber to be agile and move fast in various markets while protecting its intellectual property, the algorithm."

This 8.5-mile path is the oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States. The influence of British and European Romanticism reached North America through the transcendentalist movement, and both Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82) and Henry David Thoreau (1817-62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in North America. Thoreau's writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published \"Walking\" (1862)\". His earlier essay \"A Walk to Wachusett\" (1842) describes a four-day walking tour Thoreau took with a companion from Concord, Massachusetts to the summit of Mount Wachusett, Princeton, Massachusetts and back. In 1876 the Appalachian Mountain Club, America’s earliest recreation organization, was founded to protect the trails and mountains in the northeastern United States.\n\n问题: What is the oldest hiking trail in the US?"

Huberman is an American neuroscientist and tenured associate professor in the department of neurobiology and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine who has made contributions to the brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration and repair fields. Much of his work is focused on the visual system, including the mechanisms controlling light-mediated activation of the circadian and autonomic arousal centers in the brain, as well as brain control over conscious vision or sight.[better source needed] Huberman has been credited with coining the term \"Non-Sleep Deep Rest\" (NSDR), which he earlier referred to as Yog Nindra, which is to practices that place the brain and body into shallow sleep to accelerate neuroplasticity and help offset mental and physical fatigue.[better source needed]\n\nGraduate and postdoctoral research\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Huberman worked in the laboratory of Irving Zucker, as well as working with Marc Breedlove, at University of California, Berkeley, as part of a team that defined how early androgen exposure impacts development, and he performed the first experiments defining the structure of binocular visual pathways that set the circadian clock in the hypothalamus. From 2000 to 2004, working as a PhD student in the laboratory of Barbara Chapman at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, Huberman discovered that neural activity and axon guidance molecules work in concert to ensure proper wiring of binocular maps in the brain. Huberman was a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow researcher in the laboratory of Ben A. Barres from 2005 to 2010.\n\nHuberman was an assistant professor of neurobiology and neuroscience at University of California, San Diego, from 2011 to 2015. His lab pioneered using genetic tools to study the visual system function, development and disease. Among the Huberman Lab's discoveries was the finding that specific types of retinal neurons degenerate early in glaucoma a common blinding disease depleting sight in over 70 million people, for which there is no cure.\n\nAfter moving to Stanford in 2016, Huberman discovered and published the use of non-invasive methods such as visual stimulation to enhance regeneration of damaged retinal neurons, leading to partial recovery from blindness, especially when the stimulation is paired with specific forms of gene therapy. The work was covered extensively in the popular press, including Time magazine and Scientific American and is part of the National Eye Institute's Audacious Goals Initiative to restore vision to the blind[citation needed]. The Huberman Lab extended those findings to develop a human clinical trial using virtual reality technology to stimulate regeneration and plasticity of damaged retinal and other visual system neurons.\n\nIn 2017, the Huberman Lab created a virtual reality platform for probing the neural mechanisms underlying pathological fear and anxiety. That work involved collecting 360-degree video of various fear-inducing scenarios such as heights and claustrophobia as well as atypical fear-inducing situations such as swimming with great white sharks. The Huberman VR platform is aimed at making discoveries that will lead to developing new tools for humans to adjust their state in order to promote adaptive coping with stress. The first installment of that work was published in Current Biology, in 2021 as a collaboration with neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Edward Chang (UCSF), wherein they reported that specific patterns of insular cortex brain activity correlate with and may predict anxiety responses.\n\nIn May, 2018, Huberman Laboratory published an article in the journal Nature reporting its discovery of two new mammalian brain circuits: one that promotes fear and paralysis, and another that promotes \"courageous\"/confrontational reaction, to visually-evoked threats. That discovery prompted the now ongoing exploration of how these brain regions may be involved in humans suffering from anxiety-related disorders such as phobias and generalized anxiety.\n\nIn 2020, Huberman initiated a collaboration with the laboratory of David Spiegel in the Stanford Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, to systematically study how particular patterns of respiration (i.e., breathing/breathwork) and the visual system influence the autonomic nervous system, stress, and other brain states, including sleep.\n\nIn 2021, Huberman launched the \"Huberman Lab\" podcast with the goal of translating neuroscience into tools that can be applied in everyday life. It is a top podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. He was originally inspired to start the podcast after his appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast. Huberman also covers the evidence on supplements which include Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia), Fadogia Agrestis and many others.\n\n问题: Summarise the biography of Andrew Huberman and his most popular achievements."

Considered one of the best strikers of all time, one of the best players to play in the Premier League and Arsenal F.C's greatest player of all time. Henry was runner-up for both the Ballon d'Or in 2003 and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004. He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year a record three times, the PFA Players' Player of the Year a joint-record two times, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six consecutive times. He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times.\n\nHenry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus. However, limited playing time, coupled with disagreements with the club's hierarchy, led to him signing for Premier League club Arsenal for £11 million in 1999. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times, won two FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club, including one during an unbeaten Invincible season. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Henry transferred to Barcelona in 2007 and in the 2008–09 season, he was a key part of the club's historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. In 2010, he joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls and returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014.\n\nHenry had success with France, winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000, and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.

This redesigned Outback keeps the same body style (wagon/crossover SUV), while still receiving a few changes, such as new taillights (similar to the ones on the Forester and upcoming Legacy) and an updated, modern interior.\n\nInternally, the 2020 Outback moves to the Subaru Global Platform, which is stiffer and offers a common base to allow use of alternative powertrains, such as hybrid or all-electric. The base model sixth-generation Outback was offered with the 2.5-liter gasoline direct-injection FB25D; a turbocharged 2.4-liter FA24F that was first used on the Subaru Ascent was offered as the uplevel engine, providing improved power, torque, and consumption compared to the discontinued EZ36.\n\nIn addition to all-wheel drive coming standard on every trim, the 2021 model year also added LED adaptive steering-responsive headlights (SRH) on premium variants and a seat-belt reminder standard for all passengers.\n\nWorld markets outside of North America, including Japan, did not launch the sixth generation Outback until 2021.\n\nAustralia launched on the 20th February 2021 with a number of differences over the North American version including updated LED headlights with combined Day Running Light and turn/direction indicator with SRH (Steering Responsive Headlights) standard across all variants (the Touring model also gained Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) until 2023 when ADB became standard across all model variants), as is pushbutton-start with tailgate PIN access. There is improved camera resolution for rear, side and front driver assistance cameras, EyeSight 4.0 with roadside speed sign reading, adjustable speed limiting, and intersection crash avoidance utilising new EyeSight cameras with a wider field of view and a lower profile inside the cabin. Subaru claim the sole engine fitted to Australian Outbacks, the revised 2.5-litre FB25D, is made of 90% new components compared to the Gen5 engine as well. The Japanese Outback was announced on October 7, 2021; in Japan the Outback is offered exclusively with the 1.8-litre CB18 gasoline direct-injection turbo engine instead.\n\nIn September 2021, the European variant received a five-star rating by the European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) 2021.\n\nFor the 2022 model year, Subaru added a new trim level, the Wilderness. Outback Wilderness features 9.5 inches of ground clearance, turbocharged 2.4-liter FA24F engine, and re-tuned transmission gearing with revised front and rear gear ratios. Marketed for off-road use, the Outback Wilderness has 17\" wheels with standard all-terrain tires, enhanced body cladding, and synthetic upholstery.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about the Subaru Outback, in what year was the Wilderness trim introduced?"

        "content": "Skiing is a fun and enjoyable sport or hobby for many reasons.  For many skiers their first memories of skiing are as a kid with their parents, and brings forward fond childhood memories of snow days, hot chocolate and being outdoors.  But what makes skiing so wonderful is that is blends both individual pursuits and as a group activity.  It is a fun activity to do with a group where all the participants are experiencing the outdoors and the trails together.  At the same time, each skier is dependent on their own skills to get down the trail, thereby providing the individual to have their own challenges and experience while spending time with friends or family.  \n\nSkiing offers the opportunity to enjoy the natural wonders of the mountains and experience breathtaking views.  Every day brings different conditions the skier has to adjust to; visibility, temperature, snow conditions.  These all factor into how the skier is going to ski the terrain, which in-turn provides variety to skiing, even if you are visiting the same mountain and skiing the same trails.  \n\nSkiing is known for having a communal type of culture.  Getting on a chair lift with a stranger can often times lead to great conversations, all be it short ones, the chair lift can be a time to connect with other skiers to learn what trails are offering the best conditions, or what areas of the mountain to avoid.  Skiers often look out for one another on the slopes to ensure others are safe if someone falls.\n\nThe exhilaration of speeding down snow packed trail, with views of the mountains and valleys around you, or through the quite of snow capped trees, enjoying time with friends or family, makes skiing one of the best sports people of all ages can enjoy; from little kids to people in their 60's, 70's and even 80's can still enjoy."

        "content": "There are many controllable factors that can help improve your chances of attending a top business school such as Harvard, Stanford, or Wharton.  Four of the most important include:\n- Track record of impactful work experience\n- Strong letters of recommendation from your supervisors\n- Excellent GMAT score and, to a lesser extent, GPA\n- Compelling essays \n\nWork experience is often cited as the most important factor for business school admissions.  Candidates should look for jobs that involve building best-in-class business skills (such as working at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey) or involve leading large groups of people to accomplish important and challenging projects.  One piece of advice is to look at the resumes of successful applicants and see what types of roles they had pre-MBA.\n\nIn addition to having excellent work experience on your resume, it is equally important to have a track record of success at those jobs.  To evaluate track record of strong work performance, business schools require 2-3 letters of recommendations.  It is critical for these recommendations to be highly positive, and any lack of enthusiasm can be an instant red flag for admissions officers.\n\nIn terms of quantitative factors, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton have high average GMAT scores.  Harvard's median GMAT score, for example, was 730 out of 800 for the class of 2024.  Be sure to invest time in preparing for the GMAT, as candidates can significantly increase scores through consistent and dedicated practice.\n\nAdditionally, the essays candidates submit are very important.  The goal of a business school admissions officer to is find candidates who are likely to reach senior executive leadership or other impactful roles in society.  Your essay would ideally reflect a) an aspirational but attainable goal to reach a high impact position, and b) a clear path to get from where you currently are to your long-term goals, including a logical short-term goal immediate post-business school.\n\nSome candidates opt to hire an MBA admissions consultant, which typically costs between $2000-3000 per application.  Consider whether an MBA admissions consultant would be valuable for your process, and if so, be sure to evaluate several by having free upfront consultations."

During the build-up to depart Tanith, aChaos fleet that splintered off the main force of the coreward sector descended on the world.  Without a strong planetary defense and no time to prepare, Gaunt decided to save what soldiers he could for the imperium instead of fighting.  As chaos began attacking the planet, Gaunt organized the emergency launch of available Tanith troopers.  When all was complete, only a single strength regiment was able to get off the planet.  Tanith itself was destroyed by  the forces of Chaos from orbit and Trooper Larkin, a sniper in the regiment, dubbed the regiment 'ghosts'.  The resulting moniker of Gaunt's Ghosts was used by the men of Tanith and those who ultimately became close to Gaunt himself and the regiment."

My parents have lived here since 2007, and the boys and I lived with them for the first seven years of my youngest son’s life. We are thrilled at the opportunity to live close enough to run down the street for dinner a few times a week, see the neighbors we’ve known for 15 years, plus the fact that my parents drive the boys to school a few times a week.\n\nAs discussed, we have two very well-behaved and small (under 10 lbs) cats we adopted last year. They are the light of our lives and provide us with lots of cuddles and laughs. The boys especially would be very sad to leave them behind, so we hope that a small exception could be made to have them join us at 2225 Brittan Ave.\n\nBeyond the location, we love the house, with the wood floors and all the light. And the boys are very excited to each have their own rooms! \n\nWe hope that you will consider our family for the home. We've attached applications, driver's licenses, pay stubs, and credit reports. In order to afford the cost of living closer, my dad will be acting as Grantor. We would be more than happy to put down our deposit upon approval with a move-in date of 3/15/22. \n\nPlease let us know if you need any additional information to make your decision, and we look forward to hearing from you."

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.\n\nPicasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\n\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.\n\n问题: Locate the classification of Picasso's work over time on the text, extract including the description and the period, and place them in a bullet list"

        "content": "背景: Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise 3,000 and 4,800 feet (910 and 1,460 m), respectively, above the valley floor. The park contains dozens of other granite domes.\n\nThe high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and granite peaks, such as Mount Conness. Mount Lyell is the highest point in the park, standing at 13,120 feet (4,000 m). The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThe park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.\n\nWater and ice\n\nThe Merced River flowing through Yosemite Valley, a U-shaped valley\nThe Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the park and have carved river canyons 3,000 to 4,000 feet (910 to 1,220 m) deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately 680 square miles (1,800 km2). The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately 511 square miles (1,320 km2).\n\nHydrologic processes, including glaciation, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park. The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m2), two reservoirs, and 1,700 miles (2,700 km) of streams, all of which help form these two large watersheds. Wetlands in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from 3,000 to 11,000 feet (910 to 3,350 m) in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers.\n\n\nBridalveil Fall flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.\nYosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the Yosemite Falls is the highest in North America at 2,425 feet (739 m). Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls, which has the highest single vertical drop, 1,612 feet (491 m). Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall, which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls can become active in the park after heavy rains or melting snowpack.\n\nAll glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing cirques. Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers 160 acres (65 ha). None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the Ice Age alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the neoglacial episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the Little Ice Age). Many Yosemite glaciers, such as the Black Mountain Glacier that was discovered in 1871 and gone by the mid-1980s, have disappeared. Yosemite's final two glaciers – the Lyell and Maclure glaciers – have receded over the last 100 years and are expected by scientists to eventually disappear as a result of natural melting and climate change.\n\n问题: From the text provided, give me a summary of the most popular attractions in Yosemite National Park."

        "content": "背景: Kenneth Wayne Shamrock (né Kilpatrick; born February 11, 1964) is an American bare-knuckle boxing promoter and semi-retired professional wrestler, mixed martial artist, and kickboxer. He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other combat sports. A member of the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport. He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records. In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News in a special called \"The World's Most Dangerous Things\". The moniker has stuck as his nickname.\n\nShamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC \"Superfight\", he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC. He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the title of King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world, and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. He is the founder of the Lion's Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.\n\nIn addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock enjoyed considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion – the first world champion under the TNA banner – and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997's D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.\n\nA \"military brat,\" Kilpatrick was born at Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia, where he lived for his first four years. His father Richard Kilpatrick was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents' supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Shamrock lived in cars before being placed in a foster home. He went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14 in Susanville, California where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor.\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery. He received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors' orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season. The San Diego Chargers of the National Football League later offered him a tryout, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional wrestling, where he debuted in 1989 in the South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion.\n\n问题: Why did Ken Shamrock change his last name?"

The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is considered the world's most popular sport.\n\nThe game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.\n\nInternationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. National associations (e.g. The FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games. The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world. The final of the men's tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.\n\n问题: From the passage list down the various continental confederations under FIFA. List the results in comma separated format."

Written in the mid 20th century by J.R.R Tolkien, the story centers on Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit tasked with the impossible task of carrying and ultimately destroying the One Ring, which was forged by Sauron as a means to claim complete dominion over all of Middle-earth.   In his quest, Frodo is aided by three hobbits, a human ranger, a dwarf, an elf and a wizard.  Together this band of friends and heroes battle orcs, trolls, wargs, giant spider and a host of dark creatures in their quest to save Middle-earth.  \n\nAnother epic fantasy series is the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. Told over 14 volumes, this tale is set in a high fantasy world where magic exists, but only some can access it. The series begins with Moraine, a powerful channeler on a quest to find the prophesied \"Dragon\" who has been reborn with the power to defeat The Dark One. Moraine follows the clues to a small village and to five young men and women, one of whom she is convinced is The Dragon reborn. Throughout the series, these six, along with a coterie of interesting and intricately webbed characters quest throughout the world, fighting the emergence of dark forces and working to discover their own powers and destinies.  \n\nArguably the most popular fantasy series ever written is Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling. The seven novels in this series follow the story of Harry Potter, a young orphan who discovers on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard.

Usually, we put restrictions on screen time for kids, but remember even we are answerable to them when we spend too much time on gadgets than with people around us. We expect kids to respect us, so the same holds good for us, try to behave with them the way you to see them behave with you. Try to dedicate a few hours to spend time with them, remember it's the quality and not the quantity that matters here. Try not to correct them for everything they do, and try to set a boundary on things you can let go of. It's not a kid's job to deal with kids after all so you need to have some patience to understand them and then try to be understood."

Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program–input pairs cannot exist. For any program f that might determine whether programs halt, a \"pathological\" program g, called with some input, can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do. No f can exist that handles this case. A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first cases of decision problems proven to be unsolvable. This proof is significant to practical computing efforts, defining a class of applications which no programming invention can possibly perform perfectly.\n\n问题: From the following paragraph, what is the main conclusion about the halting problem?"

Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in January 1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\n问题: Extract the name and the release year of the albums of the rock band Pink Floyd.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests a rodent origin for Hepatitis A.[citation needed]\n\nA member virus of hepatovirus B (Phopivirus) has been isolated from a seal. This virus shared a common ancestor with Hepatovirus A about 1800 years ago.[citation needed]\n\nAnother hepatovirus – Marmota himalayana hepatovirus – has been isolated from the woodchuck Marmota himalayana. This virus appears to have had a common ancestor with the primate-infecting species around 1000 years ago.[citation needed]\n\nOne serotype and seven different genetic groups (four human and three simian) have been described. The human genotypes are numbered I–III. Six subtypes have been described (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB). The simian genotypes have been numbered IV–VI. A single isolate of genotype VII isolated from a human has also been described. Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys. Most human isolates are of genotype I. Of the type I isolates subtype IA accounts for the majority.\n\nThe mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be 1.73–9.76 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The human strains appear to have diverged from the simian about 3600 years ago.

This drill helps with developing shooting with both your right and left hand.  This will help when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually, start taking shots a little farther away from the basket.  Only move backwards when you consistently shoot a high percentage  of made shots.  Finally, you want to focus with movement without the ball.  This includes proper cuts when you are an offensive player without possession of the ball.  You also want to practice proper positioning on defense.  Practice good defensive positioning when you guard the person with and without the ball."

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

One of the founding members of the influential and experimental art punk band Wire, he branched out into electronic music, performance art, music production, and DJing during the band's extended periods of inactivity. He left Wire in 2004, and has since been focusing on solo work and collaborations with visual artists and fellow experimental musicians.\n\nWire released three albums between 1976 and 1979, Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154, before temporarily disbanding after a show at London's Electric Ballroom at the start of 1980. At this time, Gilbert formed a series of bands/projects with Wire's bassist, Graham Lewis, including Cupol, Dome, P'o, and Duet Emmo. Gilbert's collaborations with Lewis were experimental, featuring ambient music and found sounds. Dome performed at art galleries with visual displays that allowed audience interactivity. Gilbert and Lewis performed with tubes made of paper over their heads, thus restricting their vision. Artist Russell Mills frequently collaborated with Dome. In 1980, Gilbert and Lewis produced The The's debut single \"Black & White/Controversial Subject\" for 4AD, as well as the single \"Drop/So\" by A.C. Marias for their own Dome label. Between 8 and 31 August 1981, Gilbert, Lewis, and Mills took over London's Waterloo Gallery and produced MZUI, an interactive audio-visual installation where visitors were encouraged to play a number of instruments created by the artists from objects found on the site. The MZUI album, released by Cherry Red in May 1982, contains two untitled pieces based on recordings from the venue, finishing with the looped and distorted voice of Marcel Duchamp, whom Gilbert considers a key influence. Gilbert's experimental piece \"Children\", released in 1983 by Touch, features his parents talking about significant events from their childhood.\n\n问题: From the text, give me a short list of people the musician Bruce Gilbert collaborated with."

He lost his family's trust, his job, and his reputation. He was left with nothing in his darkest moment. Judge Matt realized the truth of the adage, \"Be wise when you speak,\" and committed to change for the better. Seeing his efforts, his former colleague reached out with an opportunity to return to the bench. Judge Matt embraced the chance and transformed himself, earning the trust of his family and friends. He had gained something more valuable than he had lost—the power of his words, wisdom, and compassion."

Go to meetup.com to find people who like to do similar activities like you and join them. Once you are with them, reach out and introduce yourself. If all else fails, speak to a therapist who can provide activities to help you out.\nMental health is super important so take care of yourself and your loved one."

Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\nElectric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;\nElectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.\n\n问题: How would you define electricity based on the following paragraph?"

        "content": "Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias."

        "content": "American football and European football are two different sports. American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn’t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field. Each team tried and kick the ball in the goal to get points and the winner is the team with the most point at the end of the match."

In modern armed forces troops designated special forces are usually those kept at the highest state of readiness for combat, and are often alerted only a few hours before being committed to combat.

Groups with opposing interests prevent the accumulation of power with one group.\nCritics of this theory argue that Dahl only talked about policy decisions that were openly debated.  There is a private or hidden power struggle where it is decided whether or not to consider policy at all. Second, that there are cumulative inequalities where those with a low level of resources are not able to mobilize and represent their own interests.

Savings accounts can be FDIC insured up to $250k (although there are services that can increase this limit such as Wealthfront) and thus are extremely safe places to store money, but these accounts generally have very low interest rates and thus the money will not grow quickly (or at all, compared to inflation). Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. \n\nThe stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years). The broader US stock market has historically grown nearly 10%/year on average, although many years significantly deviate from that growth rate."

Viceroy Linlithgow remarked the movement to be \"by far the most serious rebellion since 1857\".\n\nThe All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called \"An Orderly British Withdrawal\" from India. Even though it was at war, the British were prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.\n\nVarious violent incidents took place around the country against the British regime. The British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.\n\n问题: Who were supporters of Quit India movement?"

The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\n\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\n\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.\n\n问题: Please give me a bulleted list of the fundamentals of baseball"

Consuming the wrong kinds of foods can wreak havoc on human metabolism, and over time, lead to hormonal disorders, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The world is witness to increased cases of such disorders since the time of the industrialisation of the food and pharmaceutical industries. After World War 2, since the 1970s, the rates of incidence of the aforementioned diseases have increased manifold, correlated strongly with the increased consumption of processed foods, seed oils, sugar and carbohydrates while being negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fats and red meat. Thus, while the average life expectancy of human beings has increased, albeit differently for different regions of the world, with the increasing contribution of modern medical practice, the quality of life for most people has decreased. The case can be made that we, as a society, are becoming calorie-rich but nutrient-poor, with negative outcomes for public health."

        "content": "The Wimbledon Championships, commonly known simply as Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.\n\nWimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.\n\nThe tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021, following from the 2020 cancellation. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first time. It marks the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus.\n\nThe 2023 Wimbledon Championships will be the 136th staging and will run from 3 July 2023 to 16 July 2023 and it will be the first event of King Charles III since the death of the former patron, Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022."

This resulted in Irish people settling and developing communities that included Irish pubs that in turn attracted customers and were successful.

Using cellphone too much would harm your eye sight. Especially for teenagers, whose eyes are still growing, it's very easy to have near-sight pretty quickly.\n2. Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.\n3. Using cellphone too much would make you feel hard to focus on one thing. The scattered information would stimulate your attention, and make you feel excited at superficial contents, and don't think deeply.\n4. You might accidentally lost your cellphone, and you will feel sad about it.

Graduation being his first stadium album that really skyrocketed Kanye into the mainstream resulting in sold out tours and solidifying pop culture relevance. The fundamentalists fight for The College Dropout as it is a reflection of a simpler time and arguably his most honest and well produced album to date. The construction of this album was the subject of the Netflix 2022 documentary Jeen-yus.\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no right or wrong answer.

The winningest golfer based on number of Major wins is Jack Nicklaus, and the second winningest golfer is Tiger Woods. \n\nMany would say that means Jack Nicklaus is the greatest golfer of all time, however greatness can also be measured by one's impact on the game. Tiger Woods opened the door for an entire generation of young players coming from diverse backgrounds. This is a fundamental change to a sport that is historically a game of privilege and aristocracy. \n\nI would argue that the combination of having a winning record in Major events and having a significant cultural impact on the game makes Tiger Woods the greatest and most influential golfer of all time."

        "content": "背景: Abel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch: [ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).\n\nBorn in 1603 in Lutjegast, Netherlands, Tasman started his career as a merchant seaman and became a skilled navigator. In 1633, he joined the VOC and sailed to Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. He participated in several voyages, including one to Japan. In 1642, Tasman was appointed by the VOC to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean. His mission was to discover new trade routes and to establish trade relations with the native inhabitants. After leaving Batavia, Tasman sailed eastward and reached the coast of Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land after his patron. He then sailed north and discovered the west coast of New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt, but later renamed Nieuw Zeeland after the Dutch province of Zeeland.\n\nDespite his achievements, Tasman's expedition was not entirely successful. The encounter with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand resulted in a violent confrontation, which left four of Tasman's men dead. He returned to Batavia without having made any significant contact with the native inhabitants or establishing any trade relations. Nonetheless, Tasman's expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Tasman continued to serve the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time.\n\nOrigins and early life\n\nPortrait of Abel Tasman, his wife and daughter. Attributed to Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, 1637 (not authenticated).\nAbel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city.\n\nRelocation to the Dutch East Indies\nEmployed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel (Netherlands) to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. While based in Batavia, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island (in what is now the Maluku Province in Indonesia) because the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by the inhabitants of the island.\n\nBy August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled.\n\nHe was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships Engel and Gracht and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima (an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan).\n\nFirst major voyage\nIn August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands.\n\nOne of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown\" Provinces of Beach. This was a purported yet non-existent landmass said to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo's works.\n\nThe expedition was to use two small ships, Heemskerck and Zeehaen.\n\nMauritius\nIn accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel.\n\nBecause of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction, with the intention of having the Solomon Islands as their destination.\n\nTasmania\n\nCoastal cliffs of Tasman Peninsula\nOn 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nProceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, but he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on 1 December, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On 2 December, two ship's boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and then west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible \"greens\". Tasman named the bay, Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and what is now Blackman Bay. (Tasman's original naming, Frederick Henrick Bay, was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, a ship's carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.\n\nFor two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to follow the coast line but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMurderers' Bay, drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\n\nMāori haka\nTasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured a rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman claimed that his compass was the only thing that had kept him alive.\n\nOn 13 December 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island of New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to sight New Zealand. Tasman named it Staten Landt \"in honour of the States General\" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, \"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain\", referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616. However, in 1643 Brouwer's expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from the hypothetical Southern Land. Tasman continued: \"We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.\" Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined Terra Australis that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America.\n\nAfter sailing north then east for five days, the expedition anchored about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the coast off what is now Golden Bay. A group of Māori paddled out in a waka (canoe) and attacked some sailors who were rowing between the two Dutch vessels. Four sailors were clubbed to death with patu.\nIn the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore, two of which betook themselves towards us. When our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water, and with the sinking of the sun (which sank behind the high land) they had been still about half a mile from the shore. After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone's shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors' trumpets. We had one of our sailors (who could play somewhat on the trumpet) play some tunes to them in answer.\"\n\nAs Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which \"eleven swarming with people came off towards us.\" The waka approached the Zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka. It has been speculated that the local Maori had thought the Dutch were trying to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori were trying to protect. Tasman named the area \"Murderers' Bay\".\n\nThe expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which it mistook for a bight and named \"Zeehaen's Bight\". Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (Kaap Pieter Boreels was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.)\n\nReturn voyage\n\nTongatapu, the main island of Tonga; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\n\nThe bay of Tongatapu with the two ships; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\nEn route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia-i-Lau before making his way back into the open sea.\n\nThe expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived back in Batavia on 15 June 1643.\n\nSecond major voyage\nTasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people. He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although Tasman was received courteously on his return, the company was upset that Tasman had not fully explored the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans; mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\n\nLater life\nOn 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice in Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter. In his will (dating from 1657), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village, Lutjegast.\n\nAlthough Tasman's pilot, Frans Visscher, published Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land in 1642, Tasman's detailed journal was not published until 1898. Nevertheless, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers. The journal signed by Abel Tasman of the 1642 voyage is held in the Dutch National Archives at The Hague.\n\nLegacy\nTasman's ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman's suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.\n\nMultiple places have been named after Tasman, including:\n\nthe Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen's land. It includes features such as:\nthe Tasman Peninsula.\nthe Tasman Bridge.\nthe Tasman Highway.\nthe Tasman Sea.\n\nin New Zealand:\nthe Tasman Glacier.\nTasman Lake.\nthe Tasman River.\nMount Tasman.\nthe Abel Tasman National Park.\nTasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere.\nthe Tasman District.\nAbel Tasman Monument.\n\n问题: Based on this information that I have shared about Abel Janszoon Tasman, can you summarize it for me?"

One process is called thermal oxidation, which forms silicon dioxide on the surface of the silicon. This is used as a gate insulator and field oxide. Other processes are called photomasks and photolithography. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuit in the integrated circuit. Ultraviolet light is used along with a photoresist layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.\n\nThe etching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the photoresist layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called plasma etching. Plasma etching usually involves an etch gas pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create plasma. A common etch gas is chlorofluorocarbon, or more commonly known Freon. A high radio-frequency voltage between the cathode and anode is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The silicon wafer is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The result is silicon that is etched anisotropically.\n\nThe last process is called diffusion. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as doping. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the p–n junction. To get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.\n\n问题: Based on this passage, please provide a bullet-point list of the processes used to prepare semiconducting materials for integrated circuits (ICs)."

Between 1966 and 1973, fourteen singles by Sean Dunphy and The Hoedowners entered the Irish Charts including, in 1969, two number ones: \"Lonely Woods of Upton\" and \"When The Fields Were White With Daisies\". In the late 1970s, Dunphy went on to have two further hits as a solo artist.\n\nDespite undergoing a quadruple heart bypass operation in 2007, Sean Dunphy continued to give live performances. In March 2009, he sang many of his greatest hits in a one-off concert at Dublin's National Concert Hall. His last public engagement was at a charity event twenty-four hours before his death.\n\nDunphy died at his home in Baldoyle, County Dublin and is buried at Greenogue cemetery in Ashbourne, County Meath.\n\nSean Dunphy and his wife Lily had four children.

GIS and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display. Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly."

There are many opportunities for career growth because of all the technology businesses that have chosen to move here. In the job market right now, it is helpful to be near these businesses in case you get laid off from your job. The weather is mild all throughout the winter, so you won't need to scrape snow and ice off of your car every day, although there have been a number of snow storms in the last couple years but they quickly melt and only last a day or two at a time. The summers get hot and can stay above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks at a time. This may sound like a negative, but one of the best things about Austin is the access to water. Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The people are friendly, similar to Minneapolis. The tech scene feels a bit like the New York City hustle, while the West coast chill is present through the laid back, fun oriented lifestyle. You can find whatever you're looking for here, and it is worth spending time here to see how you can make the city your own."

The six naturally occurring noble gases are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn).\nOganesson (Og) is a synthetically produced highly radioactive element. Although IUPAC has used the term \"noble gas\" interchangeably with \"group 18\" and thus included oganesson, it may not be significantly chemically noble and is predicted to break the trend and be reactive due to relativistic effects. Because of the extremely short 0.7 ms half-life of its only known isotope, its chemistry has not yet been investigated.\nFor the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide toxicity.\nThe properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: Their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be \"full\", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 °C (18 °F); that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.\nNeon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over 55 m (180 ft). After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent in the Hindenburg disaster, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.\n\n问题: Based on the paragraph below, describe 2 suitable applications of noble gases."

This marked the first major commercial release of sensor-based tracking, allowing for free movement of users within a defined space. A patent filed by Sony in 2017 showed they were developing a similar location tracking technology to the Vive for PlayStation VR, with the potential for the development of a wireless headset. In 2019, Oculus released the Oculus Rift S and a standalone headset, the Oculus Quest. These headsets utilized inside-out tracking compared to external outside-in tracking seen in previous generations of headsets. Later in 2019, Valve released the Valve Index. Notable features include a 130° field of view, off-ear headphones for immersion and comfort, open-handed controllers which allow for individual finger tracking, front facing cameras, and a front expansion slot meant for extensibility.\n\nIn 2020, Oculus released the Oculus Quest 2. Some new features include a sharper screen, reduced price, and increased performance. Facebook (which became Meta a year later) initially required user to log in with a Facebook account in order to use the new headset. In 2021 the Oculus Quest 2 accounted for 80% of all VR headsets sold.

It is probably named after Robert J. Hanlon, who submitted the statement to Murphy's Law Book Two (1980). Similar statements have been recorded since at least the 18th century.\n\nOrigin\nA similar quotation appears in Robert A. Heinlein's novella Logic of Empire (1941). The character \"Doc\" in Heinlein's story described the \"devil theory\" fallacy, explaining, \"You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.\"\n\nThe quotation as such was a submission credited in print to Robert J. Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a compilation of various jokes related to Murphy's law that were published in Arthur Bloch's Murphy's Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong! (1980). It is unknown whether Hanlon knew of Heinlein's story or whether he independently constructed the phrase.[citation needed]\n\nHanlon's razor became well-known after its inclusion in the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer slang, since 1990. Later that same year, the Jargon File editors noted lack of knowledge about the term's derivation and the existence of a similar epigram by William James, though this was possibly intended as a reference to William James Laidlay. In 1996, the Jargon File entry on Hanlon's Razor noted the existence of the phrase in Heinlein's novella, with speculation that Hanlon's Razor might be a corruption of \"Heinlein's Razor\". The link to Murphy's law was described in a pair of 2001 blog entries by Quentin Stafford-Fraser, citing emails from Joseph E. Bigler. Subsequently, in 2002, the Jargon File entry noted the same. Current Jargon File refers to it as a \"Murphyism\".\n\nThe name was inspired by Occam's razor.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about Hanlon's razor, when did the adage become well-known?"

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers.

The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.

By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader. Carter himself was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team, and also joined a youth organization named the Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.\n\nCarter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia. The following year, he transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, and he earned admission to the Naval Academy in 1943.  He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.  While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946. He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen. Carter graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947 with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.\n\n问题: Given these two paragraphs, where did Jimmy Carter go to college?"

A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.\n1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'\n2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'\n3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. \n4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.\n5. Build technical capabilities that will deliver above listed business capabilities.  An online form integrated with AI Bot service and workflow automation can reduce time and manual intervention.\n\nThese technical capabilities that deliver a business capability towards a business outcome should be considered a 'Business Use Case'."

        "content": "背景: TThe first AI winter 1974–1980\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons. Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in the late 70s, new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.\n\nThe problems\nIn the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve; all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\". AI researchers had begun to run into several fundamental limits that could not be overcome in the 1970s. Although some of these limits would be conquered in later decades, others still stymie the field to this day.\n\nLimited computer power: There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.\nIntractability and the combinatorial explosion. In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem) showed there are many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time (in the size of the inputs). Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires unimaginable amounts of computer time except when the problems are trivial. This almost certainly meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would probably never scale up into useful systems.\nCommonsense knowledge and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.\nMoravec's paradox: Proving theorems and solving geometry problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This helps explain why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.\nThe frame and qualification problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.\nThe end of funding\nSee also: AI winter\nThe agencies which funded AI research (such as the British government, DARPA and NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into AI. The pattern began as early as 1966 when the ALPAC report appeared criticizing machine translation efforts. After spending 20 million dollars, the NRC ended all support. In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in England criticized the utter failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country. (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI's failings.) DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of three million dollars. By 1974, funding for AI projects was hard to find.\n\nHans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\" However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA. Instead, the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.\n\nCritiques from across campus\nSee also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\nSeveral philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could. Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied, instinctive, unconscious \"know how\". John Searle's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \"intentionality\"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\".\n\nThese critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed so far off the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \"know how\" or \"intentionality\" made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\" Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\" Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, he \"deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"\n\nWeizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA. Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.\n\nPerceptrons and the attack on connectionism\nA perceptron was a form of neural network introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science. Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that \"perceptron may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages.\" An active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the 1960s but came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert's 1969 book Perceptrons. It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Frank Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was devastating: virtually no research at all was done in connectionism for 10 years. Eventually, a new generation of researchers would revive the field and thereafter it would become a vital and useful part of artificial intelligence. Rosenblatt would not live to see this, as he died in a boating accident shortly after the book was published.\n\nLogic and symbolic reasoning: the \"neats\"\nLogic was introduced into AI research as early as 1959, by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal. In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog. Prolog uses a subset of logic (Horn clauses, closely related to \"rules\" and \"production rules\") that permit tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition.\n\nCritics of the logical approach noted, as Dreyfus had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof. McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.\n\nFrames and scripts: the \"scuffles\"\nAmong the critics of McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise.\" Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\", as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.\n\nIn 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow \"scruffy\" researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be \"logical\", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures \"frames\". Schank used a version of frames he called \"scripts\" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.\n\n问题: What factors contributed to the decline of AI research in the 1970s?"

Situated on San Agustín Street, the bullfighting museum is dedicated to the matador Francisco Montes Reina (1805–1851), nicknamed \"Paquiro\", who was born in this town. He is considered the most important 19th century bullfighter, because of his skill at the sport, on foot or on horseback. The bullfighting displays include pieces of great historical and artistic value. It was inaugurated in 2003 and founded by Pedro Leal Aragon who for seven years collected objects, souvenirs and bullfighting implements. One of its first events was a group show of the artists Antonio Vela, Carlos Quevedo, and Paloma Garcia. After a renovation, it re-opened in June 2005 with miniature models of the bullring in Ronda, a head bust of Paquiro, and an original painting by Antonio Cavanna.The expansion also housed Spain's most important bullfighting collection, Collection Sagnier, which was acquired by the city to improve the historical and artistic quality of the municipal bullfighting museum. There are four rooms: bullfighting origins, Paquiro and his time, contemporary bullfighting, and the bull and the arts. The museum's garden is used for book presentations, press conferences, weddings and small concerts.

Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin (Dafoe) in the process.\n\nDevelopment on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January to June 2001. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film's visual effects.\n\n问题: Based on the passage, which directors were considered for directing the Spider-Man movie apart from Raimi?"

        "content": "India ranks as the number one country in the world in providing technical support and Information technology related services. India has more than 50% of the global IT outsourcing share (https://idapgroup.com/blog/it-outsourcing-to-india/#:~:text=Indian%20IT%20in%20Numbers%20%26%20Facts&text=Holds%2055%25%20of%20global%20IT,countries%20all%20over%20the%20globe.) \n\nIndia has a large educated young workforce that forms the core engine for driving the growth of IT services from India. This workforce is trained in skills in demand, namely the Information technology related topics, from the many universities spread across the country. \n\nEnglish is a language commonly used in India. There is a huge workforce that is well trained and proficient in English. This is a huge advantage when it comes to providing services to global customers who are looking to use a team that is able to communicate in English.\n\nIndia is a developing country. The cost of living and the salary scale for employees is low compared the salary for similar employees in developed countries such as the United States of America, Great Britain, Australia, France, etc. The difference in salary levels provides a natural cost arbitrage that provides a compelling reason when a company is exploring to outsource.\n\nThe combination of the above factors namely availability of a trained workforce that is able to communicate in English and the arbitrage in salary costs makes India an attractive outsourcing partner for many businesses in the developed countries."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "As a renter, you’ll often find yourself hanging pictures, assembling furniture, installing floating shelves, opening and cutting up boxes, storing things on high shelves, tightening screws or bolts that come loose over time, cleaning cobwebs, measuring furniture or a room where you’d like to put furniture, unclogging a toilet, or any number of other activities centered around daily apartment life. \n\nTo do these things, you’ll need a small number of tools, including:\n- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1” wide tape measure. Get one that’s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10” to 12” long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You’ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8” and larger 10” adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood…etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand…you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You’ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it’s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You’ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you’ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you’d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford."

Their moms made them believe they could do no wrong. They never learned how to be considerate of other people's feelings. They learned that no matter what, mama would always be around to clean up their mess — literally and figuratively. Their moms did their laundry well into their twenties. They don't know how to do basic things around the house like boil an egg, cook rice or pick up after themselves. A telltale sign of a mama's boy: he comes home with a new purchase, opens it up, leaves all the plastic packaging lying around on the kitchen table. It doesn't bother him. He literally does not see the trash he leaves around. Mama's boys don't know how to pay their bills, manage their checking accounts, do grocery shopping and many, many more things. But these behaviors are symbolic of a much deeper deficiency: their emotional intelligence is practically nonexistent. Typically, it takes decades to train a mama's boy to be a fully functioning adult who can be an acceptable partner. It's possible only if he's willing to admit his faults and try every day to be a better human being."

Cheaper transportation options may take a longer time. \n\nThe methods of transportation include airplanes, trains, ships or ferries, busses, and cars, but not all locations have all these transportation methods available.\n\nUsually, if the two places are relatively close to each other, a bus or a train may be a good option. If public transportation between these two places is not well established, then a personal car may be a reasonable alternative.\n\nIn some circumstances, when the distance between the two place is very short, less than three miles or so, walking may be your best option.

The fires can spread quickly, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions, and can be difficult to control. Firefighters often work long hours in dangerous conditions, battling flames that can reach hundreds of feet high.\n\nDespite the risks, California's firefighters are highly trained and equipped with state-of-the-art technology to help them do their jobs. They use a range of tools, from helicopters and bulldozers to chainsaws and shovels, to contain the fires and prevent them from spreading.\n\nFirefighters working on California wildfires come from all over the state and sometimes from other states as well. They work together in teams, coordinating their efforts to make the most effective use of resources and manpower. They work not just to control the fires, but also to help people who have been affected by them, offering shelter and support to those who have lost their homes or businesses.\n\nThe bravery and dedication of California's firefighters cannot be overstated. They put their lives on the line to protect others, working tirelessly to control fires that threaten entire communities. Their work is essential to the safety and well-being of the state's residents, and they are rightly celebrated as heroes for their efforts."

Some people will start a relationship with friends after knowing each other for years, while some will love someone who was still a completely stranger yesterday. Some people will completely rely on serendipity to meet someone new, while some use dating apps to find a potential lover with clear purposes. There are no right ways to start a relationship, but a wrong relationship can be harmful to both sides. Therefore, you should take your take and never rush into a new relationship. Some tips for finding a BF or GF:\n1. Participate in more events to meet new people. For example, exercise classes, clubs of your hobby, volunteering, and parties can be a good start.\n2. Ask your friends to recommend some guy/girl they know. Friends can be a reliable source since they share similar background and experience with you.\n3. Be nice, honest and helpful to everyone you meet. This can help you to build good reputation in your friends circle so that people are more likely to be attracted by you.\n4. Know a person well before you start developing a romantic relationship with him/her. Some people may be very different as a friend vs. in a relationship. It's better to spend more time dating, knowing his/her life before making a decision."

Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window — who is to say one’s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus — rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top — an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I’d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"

Instead, IGFBP-7 binds IGF1R, which blocks IGF-1 and IGF-2 binding, resulting in apoptosis. \n\nFunction\nIGFBP-3 was first isolated, characterized, and quantitated in human plasma, in 1986. It has well-documented functions in the circulation, in the extracellular environment, and inside cells. It is the main IGF transport protein in the bloodstream, where it carries the growth factors predominantly in stable complexes that contain the binding protein, either IGF-1 or IGF-2, and a third protein called the acid-labile subunit or ALS.\n\n问题: When was IGFBP3 first characterized?"

The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises who are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996. Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship; feats they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team's image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for a franchise built after the merger, but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. Concurrent to the lack of success outside of their Super Bowl wins, the Buccaneers hold the NFL's lowest winning percentage at .404.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, how many Super Bowls have they won."

        "content": "A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."

The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan.\n\nColombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.\n\nCanal locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, New Panamax ships.\n\nAnnual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal. In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two locks.

        "content": "Indian and Western music differ considerably in terms of pitch because Western music adheres to the concept of absolute pitch, while Indian music predominantly focuses on relative pitch. Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range."

Some network operators tried to throttle this traffic.\n\nIn May 2008, in an IETF Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure, several areas of work were identified:\n\n1. A standardized interface for the exchange of information between the underlying IP network and an overlay network, such as a peer-to-peer network. The basic idea is, that if the overlay network was aware of the topology and the cost for sending traffic through the underlying IP network, it could optimize decisions with respect to the overlay network's topology (e.g., peer selection) and routing of traffic through the overlay network. The result would be better performance or Quality of Experience in the application while reducing the utilization of the underlying network infrastructure. This work item led to the establishment of the IETF ALTO working group.\n2. Content caches in the network. This has been studied in the IETF DECADE working group. However, no new protocol has been developed and standardized.\n3. A new congestion control mechanism in the transport layer for background traffic, which \"yields\" to standard TCP. This was worked on in the IETF LEDBAT working group and has been standardized in RFC 6817.\n4. A new DiffServ code point to mark IP packets to have a lower priority than the default \"best effort\" category has been standardized in RFC 8622.\n\nThe IETF ALTO working group was established in November 2008. The first deliverables were the problem statement, the requirements document, the specification of the core ALTO protocol and an ALTO server discovery mechanism. Since then, various extensions have been specified (see below) or are still work in progress (see IETF ALTO Datatracker).\n\nOriginally designed to support peer-to-peer file sharing, the concept is broadly applicable to many network problems. However, as of 2021 it has not achieved widespread deployment in the internet. Nevertheless, there have been experiments in Internet service provider (ISP) networks and a deployment to support large data transfers for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\n\n问题: What has the IETF ALTO working group accomplished?"

        "content": "背景: A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\n\n问题: Given these paragraphs about Large language models, when did LLMs emerge?"

Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to statistically sample new data based on the training data set that was used to create them.\n\nNotable generative AI systems include ChatGPT, a chatbot built by OpenAI using the GPT-3 and GPT-4 large language models and Bard, a chatbot built by Google using the LaMDA model. Other generative AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.\n\nGenerative AI has potential applications across a wide range of industries, including software development, marketing, and fashion. Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models.\n\nModalities\nA detailed oil painting of figures in a futuristic opera scene\nThéâtre d'Opéra Spatial, an image generated by Midjourney\nA generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised or self-supervised machine learning to a data set. The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the modality or type of the data set used.\n\nText: Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT-3, LaMDA, LLaMA, BLOOM, GPT-4, and others (see List of large language models). They are capable of natural language processing, machine translation, and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks. Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia, and others (see List of text corpora).\nCode: In addition to natural language text, large language models can be trained on programming language text, allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs. Examples include OpenAI Codex.\nImages: Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include such as Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer. Datasets include LAION-5B and others (See Datasets in computer vision).\nMolecules: Generative AI systems can be trained on sequences of amino acids or molecular representations such as SMILES representing DNA or proteins. These systems, such as AlphaFold, are used for protein structure prediction and drug discovery. Datasets include various biological datasets.\nMusic: Generative AI systems such as MusicLM can be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as \"a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff\".\nVideo: Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent video clips. Examples include Gen1 by RunwayML and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms.\nMultimodal: A generative AI system can be built from multiple generative models, or one model trained on multiple types of data. For example, one version of OpenAI's GPT-4 accepts both text and image inputs.\n\n问题: What text data set examples of Generative artificial intelligence"

It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n\nAn entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier, or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship."

Similarly during inflation as Fed tries to control inflation by raising interest rates it has the inverse effect on bond prices. It is important to note that not all bonds react the same way to interest rates. For example, short term interest rate bonds may feel the impact almost immediately while long term bonds may have a gradual but likely to see more impactful price change.

Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.

The fourth plane was similarly intended to hit a federal government building in D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\n\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03, the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted to the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 target was either the United States Capitol or the White House.\n\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—its only usage to date—called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces. Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks. Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military on May 2, 2011. U.S. and NATO troops remained in Afghanistan until 2021.\n\nThe attacks resulted in 2,977 non-hijacker fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history as well as the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in U.S. history, with 340 and 72 killed, respectively. The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the New York City economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site (colloquially \"Ground Zero\") took eight months and was completed in May 2002, while the Pentagon was repaired within a year. After delays in the design of a replacement complex, the One World Trade Center began construction in November 2006 and opened in November 2014. Memorials to the attacks include the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site."

They were just playing from the songbook and the notes written down.  The Dead allowed for a more fluid approach, and provided the musicians with opportunities to go off script, and just play for the love of creating music.    The Jam genre they created led to many other bands performing in a similar style and openness, including Phish, Dave Matthews band, Widespread Panic, Blues Travelers and many more.

A player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opposition's goal line than the last defender of the opposition team. \n\nThe law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender.\n\nBeing in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \"involved in active play\", will \"interfere with an opponent\", or will \"gain an advantage\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport."

There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.  This may sound expensive, but it's worth it to have a skill that you can enjoy for a lifetime."

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"\"spheres of influence\"\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\"\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about WWII, how many fatalities happened?"

According to the Financial Times, \"The region registers close to 40 per cent of the world’s murders despite being home to only 9 per cent of the global population. According to Lapop, one in four Latin Americans was assaulted and robbed\" in 2018. Latin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime. Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.\n\nRecent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America. Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.\n\nIn Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in Brazil. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of Rio de Janeiro, armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in El Salvador, Guatemala and Venezuela during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries. There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America. The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is San Pedro Sula in Honduras, leading various media sources to label it the \"murder capital of the world.\" Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.\n\nCrime is slowing economic growth and undermining democratic consolidation in Latin America. Today, Latin America has the dubious distinction of being most violent region in the world, with combined crime rates more than triple the world average and are comparable to rates in nations experiencing war. This is taking a tremendous toll on development in the region by both affecting economic growth and public faith in democracy.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank estimates that Latin America's per capita Gross Domestic Product would be twenty-five percent higher if the region's crime rates were equal to the world average. Similarly, the World Bank has identified a strong correlation between crime and income inequality. Business associations in the region rank crime as the number one issue negatively affecting trade and investment. Crime-related violence also represents the most important threat to public health, striking more victims than HIV/AIDS or other infectious diseases.\n\n问题: Summarize this paragraph"

        "content": "背景: Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games—and later action role-playing games—created by Interplay Entertainment. The series is set during the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries, and its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and art work are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner of Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor.\n\nThe series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third entry in the main series, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November 14, 2018.\n\nBethesda Softworks owns the rights to the Fallout intellectual property. After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of Fallout to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay, but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case was settled in early 2012.\n\nOrigins\nThe ideas of the Fallout series began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and created Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of Wasteland were positives and wrote and developed a new game around them. The result was the first Fallout games, which released nearly ten years after Wasteland.\n\n问题: When was the first Fallout game released?"

The protagonist, referred to as the Vault Dweller, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13. Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system. Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "There are several things to consider when baking a cake.  Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.  If nothing is smoking, leave the mess until the cake is out and the oven has cooled.  Back to the timer - When it goes off, quickly but carefully test the cake with several toothpicks in different areas while the cake remains in the oven. (Taking the cake in and out of the oven to test will change the temperature of both the oven and the cake).  If the toothpicks are wet and sticky, the cake needs more time. If the toothpicks are clean (or a tad moist), the cake is ready to come out of the oven.   Allow cake to cool on a rack, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor!"

Some of the acts she worked with in Germany were Jimi Hendrix, Wishbone Ash and Yes. She found German society to be too restricting, and decided to move to London with her daughter in the latter half of the 1960s. Their first flat was located in a \"cold, damp and dark\" basement in West London, near the Chelsea football ground. Following that they moved to a small house off Gowrie Road in South London. During this time she came to be called a \"Punk Mummy Warrior\" who guided her daughter, Ari Up's musical pursuits and supported the development of her band, The Slits, when Ari was just fourteen or fifteen. Forster hosted numerous musician house guests, and among them was Neneh Cherry, the teenage step-daughter of Don Cherry. Cherry performed backing vocal with The Slits for a time.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, Forster was part of the bohemian scene in London. Starting in the late 1960s Forster's home in Shepherd's Bush became a crash pad, salon, and meeting place for rock musicians including Joe Strummer of The Clash, Jimi Hendrix, Jon Anderson of the band Yes, and many other bands.

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\""

        "content": "On March 3rd 1974, Jim was fired from his job as a janitor at Elmhurst Elementary School. While officially, Jim was let go due to \"budgetary constraints\", it was quite clear to him that it had more to do with his age than any financial strain on the school district. See, Jim was born in 1899, he had just turned 75 years old in January and was starting to \"slow down\" on the job. He could no longer do some of the highly intensive labor that his profession often entailed, and it became noticeable. \n\nAfter his last day of work, Jim walked to his home, which conveniently was only three blocks south of the school. On his walk, he couldn't help but feel sad and slightly embarrassed. He knew that his wife, Miriam, would understand, but he felt like he let her and himself down. For nearly 40 years, Jim worked at Elmhurst Elementary School and was beloved by the thousands of students that came through those doors. While he wasn't going to miss cleaning up student's throw-up or a cafeteria that resembled more of a war zone than a public eating space, he was going to miss the children. Watching them learn, play, and grow was always what made the job worth it to him.\n\nWhen Jim walked through the door of his one story home, Miriam was there to greet him. She could tell what had happened by the look on his face. Particularly, she could tell by his eyes. Jim's eyes were a portal into his soul and, as such, a window into his emotions.\n\nAs Jim walked through the living room and into the kitchen, he saw two people, a man and a woman, sitting at the table, and in the woman's arms was a baby. This man was his son, Tommy, who he had not seen since he deployed for the Vietnam War three years prior. Up until this moment, Jim wasn't even sure if his son was alive. Jim's eyes opened wide with sheer elation at the sight, and a tear slowly formed in the corner of his left eye.\n\nOver the next few hours, Jim sat with his son and his family and discussed all that had happened since the last time they had seen each other. Tommy spoke about how he had been designated as MIA by the US government after a particularly brutal ambush during one of his morning patrols. After many months of hiding from the enemy and searching for his unit, Tommy eventually stumbled across one of the final remaining US camps stationed in South Vietnam. It was at this camp that Tommy met his now wife, Sara. She was the nurse who oversaw his recovery. They fell in love immediately, got married, and Sara became pregnant, all before even leaving Vietnam for the United States. Tommy and Sara had returned to the US only a month ago, and their baby was born two weeks later.\n\nWhile Jim laid in bed that night, he couldn't believe all the change that one day could bring. He woke up a janitor, and went to bed a grandfather. He knew his new job, and he looked forward to it. This was the best day of his life."

I’m not actually busy, I’m just on my phone texting about the big party tonight. My friends and I are planning it out step by step, and hopefully at the end of the night, one of us will score a hot boy.\n“ You haven’t done any chores all month! I wish you were more like your step-sisters,” my stepmother continues angrily. The last part about my step-sisters really infuriated me. I storm downstairs ready to make a point that I’m not going to do chores for someone who isn’t my real mom.\n“Well maybe you're just jealous you didn’t peak in high school. I bet no one wanted to be your friend in school,” I argue. I put a smug look on my face, thinking that I totally just won this argument.\n“If you want to act like that I’ll give you the same treatment,” she warns me. She crosses her arms and taps her foot impatiently waiting for my response.\n“Whatever, if your're so fond of my step-sisters they can just do my chores,” I sigh as I roll my eyes.\n“You need to learn how to take care of yourself. Soon enough, your only achievement would be peaking in high school. You’re going to end up as a fast-food worker if you keep acting like this,” She reasons whilst she stares at me with daggers in her eyes.\n        \n                        “Fine, I’ll do the laundry. After I have to go to the mall, my friends and I are going dress shopping for the party,” I groan. I have to text my friends that I will be five minutes late. I grab my phone to message them.\n“Just the laundry isn’t enough for all of the chores you have ignored. You turn eighteen in two years, and you need to prepare for the real world. You will not go to the party; what you will do is stay here until you cleaned and organized the entire house to make up for the several years of not doing any chores at all,” She states.\nI can’t believe my ears. My life is literally ruined. She is seriously out to get me I swear. I flip my hair and start to walk over to my room.\n“I’m going to run some errands. When I’m back, I expect all the clothes to be folded, the kitchen wiped down, etcetera. Perhaps if you finish fast enough, you can still make it to the party. Maybe.” She orders and walks out of the house.\nThis is child abuse. I stomp my foot in frustration and call all my friends. I complain about all of the evil things my stepmother just did to me.\n                        “You should just sneak out, you do it all the time for parties,” One of my friend suggests.\n                “I would, but if my stepmother noticed I didn’t clean everything she’s probably going to take away my allowance and phone. You guys now I can’t live without those!” I point out. I pace back and forth around my room trying to think. I see an empty closet and get the perfect idea.\n           “What if I just throw in all the dirty things into the closet! That will give me enough time. She probably won’t notice for a couple of days. It’s flawless!” I proposed. Everyone agrees so I went straight to work. It only took me five minutes and I was out of the house and on my way to the mall. \n     —------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          “Dress shopping was so fun! I’m glad I could make it.” I remarked. Everyone nods in agreement. I check the time on my phone.\n                “Guys! I didn’t realize it would take us that long to find out dresses, the parties in ten minutes!” I gasp, we all run into one of our cars and arrive to the party.\n                I look around the venue. This place looks so cool, there’s a dance floor in the middle where many people are at so I head there. I see a super handsome boy in the corner of my eye, I walk over to ask him to dance. He notices me too as I reach my hand out signaling we should dance. \n          We dance until our feet are sore. It is such a nice moment, I can’t wait to brag to my friends later. I go to take a seat with him but I see my mom enter the party. I quickly run out the door and the boy I just danced with starts following. My shoe falls off but I don’t stop running until I’m back home.\n —------------------------------------------------------\n     I wake up the next morning exhausted from last night. I look at the clock and it turns out I slept until 10 am. I walk downstairs to see my mom talking to someone at the door. I look to see who it was and it was the boy I danced with last night. How did he find me? \n                He sees me peeking and waves to me. He explains to me my friends also noticed my dramatic exit and told him where my house was. He then gets on his knees and takes out a ring.\n              “Will you marry me?” He asks me. I immediately knew my answer.\n                           “No”"

        "content": "Ah, winter! It’s time to put on your long underwear. Slip in some wool socks and a sweater. Climb into your snowpants. Pull down your stocking cap. Grab your fi shing rod and bait bucket.\nThere’s ice on the lake, and it’s the season to enjoy a true Minnesota adventure, —ice fishing. Don’t worry about getting cold or bored on a frozen lake. Ice fishing is both easy and exciting. It’s fun to hike across the ice imagining hungry sunnies or walleyes lurking below. It’s an adventure to hang out around an ice hole with friends and family, telling stories and holding a funny looking fishing rod as you wait for a bite. And it’s thrilling when your bobber suddenly  vanishes down the hole, and you pull a slippery fish from the water with a splash. So grab a grown-up, a Thermos of hot cocoa, and get ready for an ice fishing adventure.\n\nStart with a visit to your local bait store or DNR Fisheries office. Folks there can tell you in which lakes the fish are biting and where you can get onto the lake. They can also tell you where the ice is most likely to be OK. Wind, warm weather, underwater springs, and currents can all make ice unsafe. Ice must be at least 4 inches thick before you walk on it. (See Be Safe, page 45.) Once you know the ice is thick enough, you can go find a fishing spot. Here are three ways to look: § If you know where fish hang out in summer, go there. Fish usually go to the same places in winter. § Pick up a lake map at the bait shop or DNR and look for shallow areas or drop-offs (where the bottom gets deep quickly). Fish are more likely to be there. § Look for anglers congregated at the best fishing holes. Ask if you can fish near them. (It’s not polite to drill holes too close to other anglers.) If the fish aren’t biting in one spot, try another.\n\nYou can use a regular reel, or some anglers use a device called a tip-up instead. A tipup has two sticks. One lies across the hole. The other points down into the hole and has a spool with line. When a fish takes your bait, a flag springs up from the stick across the hole. Then you pull the fish up with the line. Tip-ups are fun because you can watch them while reading a book or tossing a Frisbee.\n\n1.\tCut a Hole.\na.\tTo catch fish through the ice, you must first drill a hole. To drill a hole, ice anglers use a tool called an auger, which looks like a giant screw with a sharp blade on the end. Another handy tool is a spud, a long-handled chisel with a sharp blade for checking ice thickness and chipping extra ice from the hole. Anglers use a scoop, a big spoon with holes, to clean out ice shavings.\n\n2.\t Find the Depth\na.\tIf you know the depth of the water, you have a better idea what fish to fish for. Bluegills and northerns like shallow water. Look for walleyes in deeper water. Some anglers use an electronic fish locator or a lead weight on a hook. You can also tie a string to a weight, hold the loose end in one hand, and drop the weigh to the bottom. Then measure the length of string that’s down the hole. The simplest solution is to use a weighted hook, which drops to the bottom. Then you reel it up to fish as far off the bottom as you like. \n\n3.\tLand your Catch\na.\tWhen you feel a fish on the line, reel it up steadily but not too fast because you might yank out the hook. When you see the fish, ask your adult fishing buddy to lift it out. After landing a fish, remove it from the hook. It’s easier to get a hook out with pliers than with your hands in cold weather. If the fish is too big or too small to keep, return it to the water. Or put your catch in a bucket or a snowbank. Watch out for dogs! A dog might try to run away with your catch! It happens. \n\n4.\tUse Good Manners\na.\tBe polite and don’t disturb your fellow anglers with loud talk or goofing around. Always pick up your trash and anything else you brought. Remember: Anything you leave on the lake will go into the water when the ice melts."

The Super Mushroom increases the character's size, turning them into a \"Super\" variant, and allows them to break certain blocks. When hit by an enemy, the character reverts to their smaller size instead of losing a life. When the character is in their \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the Amanita muscaria, with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview that beta tests of Super Mario Bros. proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario. Different variants of mushroom power-ups appear in the series. For example, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels introduces the Poison Mushroom, which causes damage when collected; and New Super Mario Bros. introduces the Mini Mushroom, which shrinks the character to miniature size; and the Mega Mushroom, grows the character into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3 introduces suits to the Super Mario series, many of which are based on animals or Mario enemies. The Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide the character with a tail that enables flight. In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets the character spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a Hammer Bros. suit, which allows Mario and Luigi to throw hammers as projectiles to defeat enemies at a distance. Other suits in later games in the series include the Frog Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit, Boomerang Suit, and Bee Suit.\n\n问题: Given the text, write a summary of the effects of the Super Mushroom power-up in the Super Mario videogame series"

The project was created by Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie, who were soon joined by other Google engineers, including Brian Grant and Tim Hockin.\n\nThe design and development of Kubernetes was influenced by Google's Borg cluster manager. Many of its top contributors had previously worked on Borg; they codenamed Kubernetes \"Project 7\" after the Star Trek ex-Borg character Seven of Nine and gave its logo a seven-spoked wheel. Unlike Borg, which was written in C++, Kubernetes source code is in the Go language.\n\nKubernetes 1.0 was released on July 21, 2015. Google worked with the Linux Foundation to form the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and offered Kubernetes as a seed technology. In February 2016, the Helm package manager for Kubernetes was released.\n\n问题: Based on this wikipedia paragraph, what original tool was Kubernetes based on?"

The club has won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English football.\n\nArsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position. Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for nineteen consecutive seasons.\n\nHerbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers; he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\n\nIn 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913 the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of £340.3m in the 2019–20 season, Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the world's eighth most valuable club, while it is one of the most followed on social media. The motto of the club has long been Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for \"Victory Through Harmony\".\n\n问题: Using the information in the paragraph, give me a short bulleted list of Arsenal football club's main achievements"

I want to answer those questions today — and talk about how we as a company will answer questions like that moving forward.\n\nFor years, we’ve shared that one of our aspirations is to build a wildly successful public company. Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here’s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don’t follow those rules can be serious — the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we’ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that’s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this — \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" — is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don’t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I’m going to share some updates about how we’ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won’t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates. Instead, emphasize our massive opportunity, how we’re innovating, delivering value to our customers, and what an awesome team we have.  \n\nWe can’t engage with public market investors or financial journalists on certain topics. That means if a financial analyst, research analyst or reporter reaches out to you, don’t respond and forward the email to the communications team.\n\nWe also can’t talk about a potential IPO on social media or with friends and family. You get the idea.\n\nI know that this will be different for us. We’ve always been a transparent company and this change is hopefully a short-term one. But it is an important one and you all have a role to play in helping us remain compliant.\n\nWe all have different, important roles to play in making this company a successful, long-term business. The most important thing we can all do is to continue delivering for our customers and building a successful business."

Male alpacas cluck to signal friendly behavior.\n\nScreaming: Their screams are extremely deafening and loud. They will scream when they are not handled correctly or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy.\n\nScreeching: A bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the opponent.

Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\n\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\n\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.\n\n问题: What are redo logs in Oracle RDBMS?"

In 1923, he was appointed leader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, but in 1931 he moved to Manchester as a Professor at the Royal Manchester College of Music.\n\nThe move to Manchester led to the formation of the Henry Holst String Quartet with Charles Taylor (second violin), Herbert Downes (viola) and Anthony Pini (cello). The ensemble was recognised as fine quartet, touring extensively in the UK and broadcasting on BBC Radio. They played a number of times in Liverpool for the Rodewald Concert Society in the 1934 and 1937 seasons.\n\nErnest Element (2nd violin) and Frank Venton (viola) also sometimes played for the quartet. Herbert Downes left to lead his own quartet in 1935. Charles Taylor also left to found his own quartet and was replaced by Reginald Stead as second violin. Reginald Stead later became the leader of the BBC Northern Orchestra. Anthony Pini joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1932 and was replaced by John C Hock as cellist.

It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.\n\nChess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack (in \"check\") whereby there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.\n\nOne of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.\n\n问题: Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary the game of chess"

Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation).

After reading a draft of Heuer's account, Mowat invited them to visit him at his summer farm in Cape Breton Island.\n\nAccompanied by their two-year-old son Zev and dog Willow, the couple left their home in Canmore in May 2007 for a 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi), six-month trek east across Canada. From Canmore, 100 kilometres west of Calgary, they canoed to Hudson Bay, visiting many of the settings that Mowat wrote about in Never Cry Wolf, Lost in the Barrens and People of the Deer. From Hudson Bay, their plan was to travel by sea to northern Labrador, the setting of Mowat's stories such as The Serpent's Coil, Grey Seas Under, Sea of Slaughter and A Whale for the Killing. From Newfoundland and Labrador they planned a final journey by water, arriving at Cape Breton near the end of October.

        "content": "背景: Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862. \nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.\n\n问题: What did ancient cultures around the Mediterranean know about electricity?"

Improvements included the AMBER weapons rack to carry up to 22 air-to-air missiles, infrared search and track, advanced avionics and electronic warfare equipment, AESA radar, and revised structure with a service life of 20,000 hours. Single and two-seat variants were proposed, called F-15CX and F-15EX respectively, with identical capabilities. The USAF opted for the two-seat variant, which can be flown either by a single pilot or by a pilot and WSO for complex missions and, someday, controlling collaborative combat aircraft. One reason for this decision is that only two–seat F-15 models remained in production.\n\nThe USAF bought the F-15EX to maintain fleet size as F-22 production ended, the F-35 was delayed, and its F-15Cs aged. Although it is not expected to survive against modern air defenses by 2028, the F-15EX can perform homeland and airbase defense, enforce no-fly zones against limited air defenses, and deploy standoff munitions. In July 2020, the U.S. Defense Department ordered eight F-15EXs over three years for $1.2 billion. In August 2020, the USAF announced plans to replace F-15Cs in the Florida and Oregon Air National Guards with F-15EXs. The F-15EX made its maiden flight on 2 February 2021. The first F-15EX was delivered to the USAF in March 2021, and was flown to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida for further testing.\n\nOn 7 April 2021, its official name Eagle II was announced. The FY2021 defense appropriations bill funded F-15EX procurement at $1.23 billion for 12 aircraft, bringing total orders to 20 aircraft. By May 2022, the USAF had ordered 144 F-15EXs. It has proposed reducing its orders to 80. The first operational F-15EXs are not to receive conformal fuel tanks. The Air Force's proposed budget for fiscal 2024 includes funds to buy 24 more F-15EXs, which would bring the planned fleet up to 104 aircraft.\n\n问题: Why is the F-15EX Eagle II an ideal aircraft not an ideal aircraft for conducting modern offensive war fighting?"

It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.5 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras.\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. Over the first hundred years the kingdom of Greece sought its territorial expansion, which was mainly achieved in the early 20th century, during the Balkan Wars and up until the catastrophe of Greece's Asia Minor Campaign in 1922. The short-lived republic that followed, beset by the ramifications of civil strife, came to an end in 1936, when the imposition of a royalist dictatorship inaugurated a long period of authoritarian rule, marked by military occupation during World War II, civil war and military dictatorship. Greece achieved record economic growth from 1950 through the 1970s, allowing it to join the ranks of developed nations. Democracy was restored in 1974–75, and Greece has been a parliamentary republic ever since. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n问题: List the name of the areas surrounding Greece and group by directions from the passage.

In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.\n\n问题: What is the primary information in this paragraph?"

In tennis, players also hit the ball back and forth but they hit it to each other over a net. In tennis, the ball has a fuzzy outer layer which causes the ball's trajectory to be more influenced by the spin on the ball. The rackets in tennis are larger and have higher tension.\n\nA tennis court is much larger than a racquetball court measuring 78 ft long and 36 ft wide.

Rost sacrifices himself to save Aloy from their leader, Helis (Crispin Freeman). When Aloy awakens, the Matriarchs explain that Aloy was found as an infant before a sealed door within the Nora's sacred mountain and that these suspicious origins were the reason for her being an outcast. The Matriarchs name Aloy a \"Seeker,\" allowing her to leave their lands in pursuit of the cultists. Aloy eventually learns that the cultists are part of a splinter Carja faction called the Eclipse and that Aloy was targeted due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch). Aloy locates the ruined corporate campus of Faro Automated Solutions and discovers that the Old World was destroyed nearly a thousand years ago after Faro lost control of its automated peacekeeper military robots. The robots, which could self-replicate and consume biomass, overran the planet and engulfed the biosphere, stripping Earth of life. Zero Dawn, a project spearheaded by Sobeck, was initiated to create an automated terraforming system to deactivate the robots and restore life to Earth.\n\n问题: Based on the given passage tell me who masked cultists are?"

Eye types can be categorised into \"simple eyes\", with one concave photoreceptive surface, and \"compound eyes\", which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface. Note that \"simple\" does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity. Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment. The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1°. Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures. Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated (as in the vertebrates) or rhabdomeric. These two groups are not monophyletic; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells,  and some gastropods, as well as some annelids possess both.\n\nSome organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms. These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about different types of eyes, how are eye types categorized and why?"

        "content": "背景: Twenty20 cricket is claimed to have resulted in a more athletic and explosive form of cricket. Indian fitness coach Ramji Srinivasan declared in an interview with the Indian fitness website Takath.com that Twenty20 had \"raised the bar\" in terms of fitness levels for all players, demanding higher levels of strength, speed, agility and reaction time from all players regardless of role in the team. Matthew Hayden credited retirement from international cricket with aiding his performance in general and fitness in particular in the Indian Premier League.\n\nIn June 2009, speaking at the annual Cowdrey Lecture at Lord's, former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist pushed for Twenty20 to be made an Olympic sport. \"It would,\" he said, \"be difficult to see a better, quicker or cheaper way of spreading the game throughout the world.\" In a similar vein, several commentators have noted that the T20 format has been embraced by many Associate members of the ICC partly because it is more financially viable to play.\n\nFormer Australian captain Ricky Ponting, on the other hand, has criticized Twenty20 as being detrimental to Test cricket and for hampering batsmen's scoring skills and concentration. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell made similar complaints, fearing that young players would play too much T20 and not develop their batting skills fully, while former England player Alex Tudor feared the same for bowling skills.\n\nFormer West Indies captains Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding and Garfield Sobers criticised Twenty20 for its role in discouraging players from representing their test cricket national side, with many West Indies players like Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine and Dwayne Bravo preferring instead to play in a Twenty20 franchise elsewhere in the world and make far more money.\n\n问题: Using the passage, please give some critical impacts that Twenty20 format had on the game of cricket?"

Regardless of a player's role on the team, Twenty20 had \"raised the bar\" in terms of fitness standards for all players by requiring better levels of strength, speed, agility, and reaction time.\n\nAlthough numerous important commentators, including Adam Gilchrist, have praised the Twenty20 format as a better, faster, and more financially feasible manner of promoting the game of cricket around the world, the format has been criticized by other famous cricketers. Some of the impacts of this format on the game of cricket are: \n\n1. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has blamed Twenty20 cricket for harming Test cricket and impairing batsmen's scoring skills and concentration.\n2. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell had similar concerns, saying that young players might play too much T20 and not fully develop their batting skills.\n3. Former England player feared that bowlers playing only Twenty20 format many not develop bowling skills fully.\n4. Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding, and Garfield Sobers criticized Twenty20 for its role in discouraging players from playing for their country's test cricket team and instead play in a Twenty20 franchise cricket elsewhere in the world to make more money.\n\nIn summary, Twenty20 format had both positive and negative effects on the overall game of cricket."

If the leak only happens when it is raining, then shut off the main water supply and see if the leak still happens.  If yes, then it is likely from rain.  If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.  If hosing down a specific feature does in fact cause dripping within that four hour window, then either call a roof repair company or go to your local hardware store and talk to an expert about ways to seal cracks or gaps in siding or roofing material."

Since a person only seeks promotion every few years, they generally don't know how to write a proper promo packet. Here are a few tips about writing a promo packet.\n\nFirst you need to describe your team and your role on the team, so the committee understands your context. For example, being the tech lead of Amazing Service for the past 2 years.\n\nSecond you need to describe the biggest accomplishments in recent years, typically up to 5. For example, launched Amazing Service or improved SLA from 3 9s to 4 9s.\n\nNext you need to show your actual work closely matches the requirements of the next level. For example, designed and built the security system for Amazing Service, or hired and managed the Amazing Service team, or initiated Amazing Service and grew it to $100M ARR.\n\nThe above points are your promo rationale, which should be the focus of your packet. The rest of the packet is to provide verifiable evidence to your rationale.\n\nA good promo packet informs the committee of your role, your accomplishments, the next level traits demonstrated in your accomplishments , plus sufficient evidence. Best luck!"

The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million, comprising soldiers, officers and adherents collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\n\nThe theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".\n\nThe Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition. Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.\n\nIn 2011, Charity Watch rated the Salvation Army an \"A−\" to an \"A\", indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency. The Salvation Army has received an A-rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.\n\nThe Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid,[citation needed] with expenditures including operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the fourth largest charity in the United States, with private donations in excess of $2 billion in 2022, and is a member of the American organisation Christian Churches Together.[10\n\n问题: how much traffic actually is drawn to this page and how long to user spend reading and hovering over this paragraph?

Washington was an avid fox hunter. The birth of this breed can be credited to Washington, and his relationship with Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette gifted a group of French Hound’s to Washington, from there around two years after, Washington acquired eight regular hounds from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and 2 “Slow Pace” hounds from England.  From these 3 breeds of dogs, from America, France and England, Washington then bred the American Foxhound. Washington had no desire to breed this dog for attention to legacy, but rather for personal gain – to hunt foxes with his own collection of specially bred hunting dogs. Washington bred the American Foxhound in hopes of breeding faster speed and tracking of foxes into the breed of hounds he already owned. \n\n问题: How did the American Foxhound originate?"

Over the last century, the working hours have been reduced and it has benefited employees as well as employers. A few key benefits include reduced burnout of employees, higher productivity, reduced carbon footprint and less number of absences. It can also help attract talent in the job market.

If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, Pioneer 11 was acting as a \"pioneer\" in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings, but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process.\n\nPioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 mi). The object was tentatively identified as Epimetheus, a moon discovered the previous day from Pioneer's imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the Voyager flybys, it became known that there are two similarly sized moons (Epimetheus and Janus) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer's near-miss. Pioneer 11 encountered Janus on September 1, 1979 at 14:52 UTC at a distance of 2500 km and Mimas at 16:20 UTC the same day at 103000 km.\n\nBesides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.\n\n问题: Which moons of Saturn did Pioneer 11 encounter and image?"

        "content": "In Machiavelli’s, The Prince, Machiavelli describes in great detail the extent to which a true prince should rule their state to ensure complete dominance and obedience of its people. He explains the numerous prerequisites and responsibilities of a prince, in which he exemplifies throughout the text through the different figures, in both positive and negative contexts. Throughout The Prince, one figure, who Machiavelli makes clear he has great respect for, highlighting quite frequently, is Cesare Borgia whom he even refers to with the status comparable to the level of God exclaiming that “there was one man who showed glimpses of greatness... that made you think he was sent by God” (26). Similar rhetoric is frequently used to describe Cesare Borgia throughout the text. In search of who truly exemplifies the characterization of “The Prince,” it can generally seem to be Cesare Borgia from the high praise of Machiavelli, but in reality this is not the case. Rather, the title of “The Prince” belongs to a more subtle figure: Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. This connection is made because of the numerous contradictions Machiavelli makes in praise of Cesare Borgia and other important figures in the text, while many key characteristics of a true prince that Machiavelli speaks of hold without contradiction for Ferdinand.\nMachiavelli exemplifies his teachings through Cesare Borgia’s actions seen in chapter 7 when Cesare Borgia conquered the state of Romagna: immediately crushing the opponent using great cruelty, using a scapegoat to thwart the hatred away from him, and finally killing the scapegoat to create a sense of power and fear within the new states inhabitants. These actions, that explain why he is so highly idolized by Machiavelli, do not go without the fact that other\n \n fundamental characteristics of Cesare Borgia directly contradict Machiavelli's notion of the most dominant prince. A prime example is in how “Cesare Borgia... acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it” (7). Inheritance obviously requires significantly less effort compared to creating a new principality. Although Cesare Borgia later conquers new principalities, it can be inferred that a rise to power through his fathers fortune was a significant catalyst and does not exemplify virtues of the ideal prince.\nOther figures in the book receive similar praise in leadership abilities, but still lack what qualities compare to the ideal prince. These figures include Pope Julius II, whose power is highlighted by Machiavelli in chapter 13 as being consistent more with fortune rather than virtù in his campaign for conquer, Pope Alexander VI, who although displays cunning ability to bring the catholic empire eventual dominance and power, did so with the initial help of being “granted a title and income from the Roman Catholic Church by his uncle Alonso”.1 Many figures follow the same pattern in that they follow many principles exemplified in The Prince, but of course with so many requisites to be a true prince, these figures do not follow the explicit definition of a prince. One figure however, follows Machiavelli’s points very closely and exemplifies the fundamentals of a true prince in his beginnings, leaving almost no flaws in his rise to becoming a true prince: Ferdinand of Aragon.\nFerdinand’s characteristics lead him to the title of “The Prince” but a core virtù is what truly sets him apart from the other figures: his rise to power. Almost immediately in The Prince, Machiavelli describes the differences between principalities and emphasizes how maintaining a\n1 “Alexander VI.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-VI.\n \nnew principality is far more difficult than inheritance. This is largely evident in Ferdinand’s rise to leadership in what Machiavelli describes him as “, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom” (21). Ferdinand demonstrates his cunning deception through his plot for power, “always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes,  himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors” (21). Machiavelli marks this never being “a more admirable example, nor one more rare” in which he uses religion as a cloak of invisibility to deceptively conquer states (21). These natural abilities are what make Ferdinand admirable and what separate him from the rest of the figures in the text. This feeling is shared by Machiavelli exclaiming “that his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him” (21)."

        "content": "Here is a proof by contradiction that the square root of 2 is irrational. First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove."

Top reason is when English invaded South east asia they brought this game to the continent. Originally this game was only played by upper class, and later adopted by other classes as well. To play cricket you need one bat and one ball. Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team or get them all out before they can make more runs then them. Most popular cricket format is T20, then One day internationals (ODI) and then Test matches. T20 is the shortest form and have 20 overs and 2 innings. ODI has 50 overs and 2 innings. Whereas Test is the longest format and can carry on for 5 days, with 90 overs every day and up to 2 innings per team. Both men and women play cricket. Worlds biggest cricket league is IPL in india. PSL in Pakistan is considered as the second best league. There are 2 cricket worldcups. T20 worldcup is played every 2 years and ODI worldcup is played every 4 years. There is also World Test and ODI championship as well, which is player every year."

However, this question is complicated by others who state that comparing players across different generations is not possible, and thus the debate should be focused on who is the greatest player within a given generation.\n\nThe NBA.com website states that \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time\". Jordan's perfect record in the finals, dominance over contemporaries (many of whom did not win any championships during the years Jordan was active), and holding the highest career regular season scoring average are often used to justify his status as the greatest NBA player of all time.

One of the accomplishments of the system was that solid cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores. However, because cores were often off center, the wall thickness determined the size of the bore. Standardized boring allowed cannons to be shorter without sacrificing accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the shells.

Smaller deletions result in Microdeletion syndrome, which are detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\n\nExamples of chromosomal deletion syndromes include 5p-Deletion (cri du chat syndrome), 4p-Deletion (Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome), Prader–Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome.\n\nThe chromosomal basis of Cri du chat syndrome consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 5. 5p deletions, whether terminal or interstitial, occur at different breakpoints; the chromosomal basis generally consists of a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. The variability seen among individuals may be attributed to the differences in their genotypes. With an incidence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births, it is suggested to be one of the most common contiguous gene deletion disorders. 5p deletions are most common de novo occurrences, which are paternal in origin in 80–90% of cases, possibly arising from chromosome breakage during gamete formation in males.\n\nSome examples of the possible dysmorphic features include: downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly, low-set ears, preauricular tags, round faces, short neck, micrognathia, and dental malocclusionhypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downturned corners of the mouth. There is no specific correlation found between size of deletion and severity of clinical features because the results vary so widely.\n\nThe chromosomal basis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The deleted segment of reported individuals represent about one half of the p arm, occurring distal to the bands 4p15.1-p15.2. The proximal boundary of the WHSCR was defined by a 1.9 megabase terminal deletion of 4p16.3. This allele includes the proposed candidate genes LEMT1 and WHSC1. This was identified by two individuals that exhibited all 4 components of the core WHS phenotype, which allowed scientists to trace the loci of the deleted genes. Many reports are particularly striking in the appearance of the craniofacial structure (prominent forehead, hypertelorism, the wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead) which has led to the descriptive term “Greek warrior helmet appearance\".\n\nThere is wide evidence that the WHS core phenotype (growth delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive craniofacial features) is due to haploinsufficiency of several closely linked genes as opposed to a single gene. Related genes that impact variation include:\n\nWHSC1 spans a 90-kb genomic region, two-thirds of which maps in the telomeric end of the WHCR; WHSC1 may play a significant role in normal development. Its deletion likely contributes to the WHS phenotype. However, variation in severity and phenotype of WHS suggests possible roles for genes that lie proximally and distally to the WHSCR.\nWHSC2 (also known as NELF-A) is involved in multiple aspects of mRNA processing and the cell cycle\nSLBP, a gene encoding Stem Loop Binding Protein, resides telomeric to WHSC2, and plays a crucial role in regulating histone synthesis and availability during S phase.\nLETM1 has initially been proposed as a candidate gene for seizures; it functions in ion exchange with potential roles in cell signaling and energy production.\nFGFRL1, encoding a putative fibroblast growth factor decoy receptor, has been implicated in the craniofacial phenotype and potentially other skeletal features, and short stature of WHS.\nCPLX1 has lately been suggested as a potential candidate gene for epilepsy in WHS.\n\nPrader–Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurogenetic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in the 15q11-q13 region. Whether an individual exhibits PWS or AS depends on if there is a lack of the paternally expressed gene to contribute to the region.[citation needed]\n\nPWS is frequently found to be the reason for secondary obesity due to early onset hyperphagia - the abnormal increase in appetite for consumption of food. There are known three molecular causes of Prader–Willi syndrome development. One of them consists in micro-deletions of the chromosome region 15q11–q13. 70% of patients present a 5–7-Mb de novo deletion in the proximal region of the paternal chromosome 15. The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25–30% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic non-disjunction followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena). This disruption is present in approximately 2–5% of affected individuals. Less than 20% of individuals with an imprinting defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5′ end of the SNRPN gene.\n\nAS is a severe debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, speech impairment, seizures, motor dysfunction, and a high prevalence of autism. The paternal origin of the genetic material that is affected in the syndrome is important because the particular region of chromosome 15 involved is subject to parent-of-origin imprinting, meaning that for a number of genes in this region, only one copy of the gene is expressed while the other is silenced through imprinting. For the genes affected in PWS, it is the maternal copy that is usually imprinted (and thus is silenced), while the mutated paternal copy is not functional."

The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, with their first such meeting being in 1959. They would both go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and 1980s, facing each other in the Finals six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, and twice since the year 2000.\n\nThe Lakers and Celtics are tied for the highest number of championships in the NBA at 17 apiece, (12 as the L.A. Lakers and 5 as the Minneapolis Lakers). Together, they account for 34 of the 74 championships (or 45%) in NBA history. As of 2018, the Celtics and Lakers have a .590 and .596 all-time winning records respectively. As of the end of the 2020–21 season, Boston is the only team with a winning overall record against the Lakers.\n\nThe rivalry has been less intense since the retirements of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in the early 1990s. In 2008 the two teams met in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They met again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games.\n\n问题: Give me an overview of the rivalry between the Celtics and Lakers."

He was accordingly characterised as the \"evening star\" of scholasticism and as the morning star or stella matutina of the English Reformation. In 1374, Catherine of Siena began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through \"the total love for God.\" She carried on a long correspondence with Pope Gregory XI, asking him to reform the clergy and the administration of the Papal States. The oldest Protestant churches, such as the Moravian Church, date their origins to Jan Hus (John Huss) in the early 15th century. As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority, and recognised, for some time, by the Basel Compacts, the Hussite Reformation was Europe's first \"Magisterial Reformation\" because the ruling magistrates supported it, unlike the \"Radical Reformation\", which the state did not support.\n\n问题: List the names of the people mentioned in the text provided."

I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest. So I would sometimes snowboard if I was traveling with snowboarders, and ski if I was traveling with skiers."

In the early 1960, he was made the head of the Polit bureau of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). When in September 1961, the Kurdish uprising for the rights of the Kurds in northern Iraq was declared against the Baghdad government of Abd al-Karim Qasim, Talabani took charge of the Kirkuk and Silemani battlefronts and organized and led separatist movements in Mawat, Rezan and the Qaradagh regions.\n\nIn March 1962, he led a coordinated offensive that brought about the liberation of the district of Sharbazher from Iraqi government forces. When not engaged in fighting in the early and mid-1960s, Talabani undertook numerous diplomatic missions, representing the Kurdish leadership at meetings in Europe and the Middle East. In 1964, he and the Barzani family had a dispute over the direction of the KDP and Talabani left Iraq and settled in Iran. In Iran he purchased weapons without the knowledge of the Barzanis, following which he was expelled from the KDP in summer 1964.\n\nAfter the March 1970 agreement between the Iraqi government and the Kurdish rebels, Talabani returned to Iraqi Kurdistan, and rejoined the KDP, even though he wouldn't hold an office at the time. The Kurdish separatist movement collapsed in March 1975, after Iran ended their support in exchange for a border agreement with Iraq. This agreement was the 1975 Algiers Agreement, where Iraq gave up claims to the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rūd) waterway and Khuzestan, which later became the basis for the Iran–Iraq War. Believing it was time to give a new direction to the Kurdish separatists and to the Kurdish society, Talabani, with a group of Kurdish intellectuals and activists, founded the Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (Yekiaiti Nishtimani Kurdistan).\n\nIn 1976, he began organizing an armed campaign for Kurdish independence inside Iraqi Kurdistan. From 1977 onwards, he established the PUK base within Iranian Kurdistan in Nawkhan and another one in Iraqi Kurdistan in Qandil. During the 1980s, Talabani sided with Iran and led a Kurdish struggle from bases inside Iraq until the crackdown against Kurdish separatists from 1987 to 1988. Following the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990, he travelled to the United States, in order to offer his services and troops to the United States and raise support for the PUK. But his attempts did not bear the success he expected at the time.\n\nIn 1991, he helped inspire a renewed effort for Kurdish independence. He negotiated a ceasefire with the Iraqi Ba'athist government that saved the lives of many Kurds and worked closely with the United States, United Kingdom, France and other countries to set up the safe haven in Iraqi Kurdistan. In 1992 the Kurdistan Regional Government was founded. He was also supportive of peace negotiations between the Kurdistan Workers' Party and Turkey, and was also present as Abdullah Öcalan announced the ceasefire of the PKK on the 17 March and prolonged it indefinitely on the 16 April 1993.\n\nTalabani pursued a negotiated settlement to the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War, as well as the larger issue of Kurdish rights in the current regional context. He worked closely with other Kurdish politicians as well as the rest of the Iraqi opposition factions. In close coordination with Masoud Barzani, Talabani and the Kurds played a key role as a partner of the U.S. led Coalition in the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTalabani was a member of the Iraqi Governing Council which negotiated the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), Iraq's interim constitution. The TAL governed all politics in Iraq and the process of writing and adopting the final constitution.\n\n问题: Using the passage, summarise the key events of Jalal Talabani's career as a bullet point list"

That is why the Big Bang theory includes the theory of the expanding universe.

        "content": "背景: According to Anglo-American property law, a mortgage occurs when an owner (usually of a fee simple interest in realty) pledges his or her interest (right to the property) as security or collateral for a loan. Therefore, a mortgage is an encumbrance (limitation) on the right to the property just as an easement would be, but because most mortgages occur as a condition for new loan money, the word mortgage has become the generic term for a loan secured by such real property. As with other types of loans, mortgages have an interest rate and are scheduled to amortize over a set period of time, typically 30 years. All types of real property can be, and usually are, secured with a mortgage and bear an interest rate that is supposed to reflect the lender's risk.\n\nMortgage lending is the primary mechanism used in many countries to finance private ownership of residential and commercial property (see commercial mortgages). Although the terminology and precise forms will differ from country to country, the basic components tend to be similar:\n\nProperty: the physical residence being financed. The exact form of ownership will vary from country to country and may restrict the types of lending that are possible.\nMortgage: the security interest of the lender in the property, which may entail restrictions on the use or disposal of the property. Restrictions may include requirements to purchase home insurance and mortgage insurance, or pay off outstanding debt before selling the property.\nBorrower: the person borrowing who either has or is creating an ownership interest in the property.\nLender: any lender, but usually a bank or other financial institution. (In some countries, particularly the United States, Lenders may also be investors who own an interest in the mortgage through a mortgage-backed security. In such a situation, the initial lender is known as the mortgage originator, which then packages and sells the loan to investors. The payments from the borrower are thereafter collected by a loan servicer.)\nPrincipal: the original size of the loan, which may or may not include certain other costs; as any principal is repaid, the principal will go down in size.\nInterest: a financial charge for use of the lender's money.\nForeclosure or repossession: the possibility that the lender has to foreclose, repossess or seize the property under certain circumstances is essential to a mortgage loan; without this aspect, the loan is arguably no different from any other type of loan.\nCompletion: legal completion of the mortgage deed, and hence the start of the mortgage.\nRedemption: final repayment of the amount outstanding, which may be a \"natural redemption\" at the end of the scheduled term or a lump sum redemption, typically when the borrower decides to sell the property. A closed mortgage account is said to be \"redeemed\".\n\n问题: From the passage, note down the components of Mortgage."

Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called Photoautotroph. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\n问题: What is Photosynthesis"

        "content": "Photosynthesis is performed differently by different species but the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end."

Registered users can tweet, like, \"retweet\" tweets and direct message (DM), while unregistered users only have the ability to view public tweets. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its APIs.\n\nTwitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California and has more than 25 offices around the world. By 2012, more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as \"the SMS of the Internet\". By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. In practice, the vast majority of tweets are tweeted by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were fake.\n\nOn October 27, 2022, business magnate Elon Musk acquired Twitter, Inc. for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform. On December 20, 2022, Musk announced he would step down as CEO once a replacement had been found. As of April 2023, Musk has yet to announce a successor and remains CEO.\n\n问题: List the founders of Twitter from the above passage in a comma separated format."

This type of workout is focused on lifting weights to put stress on your muscles. This stress leads to micro-tears in your muscles, which heal to become even stronger than before! Some great strength training workouts include; Squats, bench press, and bicep curls. If you are looking to begin a workout regiment that you can do rather independently, running is a great option. Running leads to increased cardiovascular health and muscular strength in your legs. All that is required is a high quality pair of shoes and a sidewalk, road, or trail!"

Additionally, foods high in protein and fiber will help to keep you feeling full and lead to less binging and snacking on high calorie foods. In terms of exercise, ensure that you are staying active each day. Many people find that going for a long walk every day is a manageable way to meet their weight loss goals.

These people could be underprivileged because of several factors: ethnicity, religion, colour, language, nationality, gender, etc. The other people who do not come under the underprivileged section are the normal people.\n\nThe underprivileged people suffer major struggles in their life over decades or sometime over centuries. On the social development indices such as literacy, life expectancy, incarceration, health conditions, etc.. the underprivileged people lag behind the normal people significantly. Examples of underprivileged people include the indigenous people in many countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA and also the people of African descent in the USA. \n\nThe people from the underprivileged communities have to brought into the mainstream and in order to achieve this objective,  the required job and career opportunities have to be created. Education is a powerful tool to equip the people to gain the skills required to perform the roles. These people have been deprived of education for a long time and so the governments and the social leaders have to take the initiatives to extend education to the underprivileged. There has to be a concerted effort over a long time, some times for even 50 to 100 years, to improve the skill levels of the underprivileged people by focusing on education and training.\n\nThe underprivileged people have to be empowered citizens of the society. In order to enable these people to overcome the handicap of the suppression they have suffered for a long time, leaders from these communities have to be involved in the decision making and governance forums in the society.  As an example, in Indian Parliament around 24% of the seats are reserved only for people from the underprivileged sections to contest and get elected to become members of the parliament. Using this model to reserve seats for the. underprivileged in the governance bodies, we can provide opportunity for the underprivileged to participate in the governance and enact laws that will protect their interests. \n\nA combination of education and empowerment would go a long way in improving the life of the underprivileged people in the society."

In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. \n\nWhile storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.  Heritage oak and redwood trees which take hundreds of years to grow do pose some risks to homes and people should they fall, but overall they pose an insignificant risk to humans and buildings and need to continue to be protected in order to continue to provide their many benefits to humans."

Satisfaction is derived from the audience reaction not to the positive attributes of the good or service, but to the wealth displayed by the purchaser. In this way the cost of purchase becomes the the only factor of significance to the buyer."

Major conflicts between the two parties include the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357), and the Rough Wooing (1544–1551), as well as numerous smaller campaigns and individual confrontations. In 1603, England and Scotland were joined in a \"personal union\" when King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England as King James I. War between the two states largely ceased, although the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century, and the Jacobite risings of the 18th century, are sometimes characterised as Anglo-Scottish conflicts."

It was the first monthly decline in 11 months. In the third quarter of 2018, the index posted its best quarter since 2013. However, the index fell 11% in the month of December 2018, its worst December performance since the Great Depression. The index fell 6% in 2018, its worst year in a decade.\n\nHowever, in 2019, the index posted its best first half in 22 years including the best June since 1938.

        "content": "Orange wine was first introduced in Georgia and it dates thousands of years back. It is a variant of white wine where the skin grapes are not removed after crushing the grapes. Instead, the skins are left to ferment with the grape juice, similarly to red wine. The style of skin-contact white wine was adopted by Italian and Slovenian winemakers, after visiting Georgia. It then spread to other European countries. \n\nSkin-fermented white wines were common up until the 1960s, when fresh white wines started to dominate the market.\n\nThe term orange wine was coined only in 2004 by a British wine importer.\n\nIn Georgia skin-contact white wine is historically known as amber wine."

Depending on when you fly, your ticket class, and how close to your departure date that you buy your tickets, pricing can vary from less than $100 (91 Euros) to over $500 (455 Euros). Be sure to plan your trip and purchase tickets in advance to ensure that you save money. Also, while Munich has one major airport (MUC), Rome has two large international airports (FCO and CIA). It will take roughly 90 minutes by plane to travel from Munich to Rome, not accounting for time in the airport, security lines and customs.\n\n2. By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome."

He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning \"chief\" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.\n\nPatel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.\n\nAs the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that formed the Dominion of India. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet \"Iron Man of India\". He is also remembered as the \"patron saint of India's civil servants\" for having established the modern All India Services system.\n\nThe Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.\n\n问题: Who is called Iron Man of India and why?"

        "content": "Brazilian Jiujitsu, or BJJ, is known as the gentle art in martial arts.  BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding. Some may argue that more ruthless martial arts are intentionally designed for self defense and therefore may be more effective."

This includes Ryu and Ken—the main protagonists from Street Fighter—plus six new international newcomers. In the single-player tournament, the player fights the other seven main fighters, then the final opponents—a group of four CPU-only opponents known as the Grand Masters, which includes Sagat from Street Fighter.\n\nPlayable characters:\n\nRyu, a Japanese martial artist seeking no fame or even the crown of \"champion\", but only to hone his Shotokan Karate skills with the inner power of Chi, he dedicates his life to perfect his own potential while abandoning everything else in life such as having no family, and few friends, his only bond is with Ken. He is the winner of the previous tournament. He is not convinced that he is the greatest fighter in the world and comes to this tournament in search of fresh competition.\nE. Honda, a sumo wrestler from Japan. He aims to improve the negative reputation of sumo wrestling by proving competitors to be legitimate athletes.\nBlanka, a beast-like mutant from Brazil who was raised in the jungle. He enters the tournament to uncover more origins about his forgotten past.\nGuile, a former United States Air Force special forces operative seeking to defeat M. Bison, who killed his best friend Charlie.\nKen, Ryu's best friend, greatest rival and former training partner, from the United States. Ryu's personal challenge rekindled Ken's fighting spirit and persuaded him to enter the World Warrior tournament, as well as feeling lackadaisical in his fighting potential due to spending too much time with his fiancée.\nChun-Li, a Chinese martial artist who works as an Interpol officer. Much like Guile, she does not enter the World Warrior tournament for any personal glory except proving that she can defeat any man who challenges her. Chun-Li's ambition in the past was tracking down the movements of the smuggling operation known as Shadaloo. Her goal now is her trail being led to the tournament by seeking to avenge her deceased father by holding the Grand Master's leader of the crime syndicate responsible.\nZangief, a professional wrestler and sambo fighter from the Soviet Union. He aims to prove \"Soviet Strength\" is the strongest form of strength, particularly by defeating American opponents with his bare hands.\nDhalsim, a fire-breathing yoga master from India. Even though he is a pacifist, he uses the money earned from fighting in order to lift people out of poverty.\nCPU-exclusive characters, in the order of appearance:\n\nBalrog, an American boxer with a similar appearance to Mike Tyson. Called M. Bison in Japan. Once one of the world's greatest heavyweight boxers, he began working for Shadaloo for easy money.\nVega, a Spanish bullfighter who wields a claw and uses a unique style of ninjutsu. Called Balrog in Japan. He is vain and wishes to eliminate ugly people from the world.\nSagat, a Muay Thai kickboxer from Thailand and former World Warrior champion from the original Street Fighter. He was once known as The King of Street Fighters until he got demoted as The King of Muai Thai in his own tournament due to a narrow defeat at the hands of Ryu's shoryuken (rising dragon punch) which left a deep gash across his chest. Ever since that moment he felt disgrace, and will do anything to have a grudge match with Ryu to get his title back, even if it takes joining forces with Shadaloo.\nM. Bison, the leader of the criminal organization Shadaloo, who uses a mysterious power known as Psycho Power, and the final opponent of the game. Called Vega in Japan.\n\n问题: Extract the names of the playable characters in Street Fighter II from the passage, and list them out separated by a comma."

In part, this is because there is not one single definition of art! \n\nSome people consider art a creative process that gives only aesthetic pleasure, and does not serve any utilitarian purpose. However, even with this definition, there is not a clear dividing line between art and utilitarian creative processes. For example, some people consider the literary arts to comprise poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. We can clearly understand that non-fiction has a utilitarian purpose to educate and communicate, and arguably the other literary arts do too. So that definition of art as serving no utilitarian purpose is not very black-and-white. \n\nIf we consider art to be any creative endeavor that provides aesthetic pleasure, and that it might also be utilitarian, then there are many forms of art. Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn’t meet the standard of “purely aesthetic”. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn’t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings."

He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year. Growing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick to attend a local community college. The next year he attended the smaller Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978–1979 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird\n\n问题: Given the reference text below about Larry Bird, tell me where he was born, what he did for a living, and who his greatest professional rival was."

I was in DC that week for a work trip, and had extended my stay the weekend before and after, so we could spend time together. We'd only met a month prior, and after more than four weeks of long-distance text message exchanges,  it was exciting to finally be together in person. Our first date had been the weekend before, when we'd gone to a Jimmy Buffett concert. It was a magical night.\nIt was now 10am on the Saturday after the work week, and we were ready for another adventure.  Natalie, being from DC, wanted to show me the Dumbarton Oaks Gardens, so off we went.  Unfortunately, when we got there, the front gates were closed.  Still feeling adventurous, we decided to walk around the property, convinced we'd find an unlocked gate, door, or other way to get in.  Towards the back end of the property, while we didn't find an open gate, we did find one that was scale-able.  And that's exactly what we did.  We climbed over that fence, and welcomed ourselves to the beautiful gardens.  It was early august, and so much was still in bloom.  The gardens were empty,  and we thought we had the whole place to ourselves.  But, we soon found that that wasn't the case.  While exploring a small cottage that also seemed to double as an art gallery, we noticed a small pool right next to it.  We also noticed someone swimming in that pool. Presumably that person noticed us too, because a few minutes later a security guard came walking up to us while we were inspecting some fine smelling roses nearby.  It was too late to run away, so instead we walked up to the security guard, and thanked him for finding us.  As they escorted us out, we complimented them on the great state of the garden, though that didn't seem to calm him down much.  He was far too frustrated with the situation.  As they were about to lead us out through the front gate, we offered to pay for our admission.  They rather sternly refused, and insisted we leave immediately, which we did.  \nAnd that's how Natalie and I got our free tour of the gardens, and took one step closer to falling in love.  Three years later, we were married."

        "content": "背景: Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.\n\nMost nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.\n\n问题: List different ways in which Nuclear power can be obtained based on the passage."

        "content": "背景: The Build Back Better Plan or Build Back Better agenda was a legislative framework proposed by U.S. president Joe Biden between 2020 and 2021. Generally viewed as ambitious in size and scope, it sought the largest nationwide public investment in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs since the 1930s Great Depression-era policies of the New Deal.\n\nThe Build Back Better plan was divided into three parts:\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan (ARP), a COVID-19 pandemic-relief bill;\nAmerican Jobs Plan (AJP), a proposal to address long-neglected infrastructure needs and reduce America's contributions to destructive effects of climate change; and\nAmerican Families Plan (AFP), a proposal to fund a variety of social policy initiatives, some of which (e.g., paid family leave) had never before been enacted nationally in the U.S.\nThe first part was passed as the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and was signed into law in March 2021. The other two parts were reworked into different bills over the course of extensive negotiations. Aspects of the AJP's infrastructure goals were diverted into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in November 2021. Other AJP priorities (e.g., climate change remediation, home health care reform, etc.) were then merged with the AFP to form the Build Back Better Act. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives but struggled to gain the support of Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona in the evenly divided Senate, with unified Republican opposition. Manchin and Sinema negotiated the reduction of Build Back Better Act's size, scope, and cost significantly with Biden and Democratic congressional leaders, but Manchin, widely viewed as the key swing vote needed to pass the bill in the Senate, ultimately rejected it over the procedural tactics used. Continued negotiations between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually resulted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law in August 2022, and incorporated some of the Build Back Better Act's climate change, healthcare, and tax reform proposals while excluding its social safety net proposals.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about the Build Back Better Plan, what are the 3 parts that make up the plan?"

This is a recurring dream I have. I was right before the beginning of the exam and could not remember any of my classes of the year. On the way to the exam room I was asking all my friends to share their knowledge with me to catch up. I was  trying to locate my class book in my backpack in an attempt to read through it one last time as the class doors were getting closer and closer. My anxiety was raising. When the doors opened, instead of entering a classroom. , I stepped onto a meadow on a sunny afternoon. Very naturally my exam became a scavenger hunt to find pages of my book hidden in trees or floating on the lake. I was not surprised and quickly went about looking for a boat to retrieve the pages floating on the lake.  As I was on the boat I discovered I could float and even fly, which made it much easier to go after all the pages. Dreams are always interesting to remember. They often revolve around common topics or events, like taking exams or flying and any many other events. I have read that dreams have meaning, I will need to research the meaning of this sequence of events."

But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust."

Private managers hold a moral obligation to \nthose relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs.

        "content": "背景: World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world's nations during the Cold War and into present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities, and forge a sense of common identity.\n\n问题: Based on the reference text, what were the main countries and alliances of World War II?"

        "content": "背景: The goal of cheese making is to control the spoiling of milk into cheese. The milk is traditionally from a cow, goat, sheep or buffalo, although, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. Cow's milk is most commonly used worldwide. The cheesemaker's goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics (appearance, aroma, taste, texture). The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\n\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\n\nCulturing\nCheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').\n\nStarter cultures are chosen to give a cheese its specific characteristics. In the case of mould-ripened cheese such as Stilton, Roquefort or Camembert, mould spores (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.\n\nCoagulation\nDuring the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts κ-casein to para-κ-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.\n\n\nFresh chevre hanging in cheesecloth to drain.\nDraining\nOnce the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition. To prevent such decomposition it is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.\n\n\nMaturing cheese in a cheese cellar\nScalding\nIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 39 °C (102 °F) to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\n\nMould-ripening\nMain article: Cheese ripening\nIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a more gentle treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white mould spores have not been added to the cheese milk it is applied to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mould spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., Penicillium candida.\n\nBy taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, allowing the surface mould to grow and the mould-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur. Mould-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the fungi used are biochemically very active when compared with starter bacteria. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced with stainless steel wires, to admit air to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with Penicillium roqueforti. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as Saint-Nectaire, may also be influenced by yeasts which contribute flavour and coat texture. Others are allowed to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances, e.g. by the growth of Brevibacterium linens which gives an orange coat to cheeses.\n\n问题: From the provided description of the cheesemaking process, list the ingredients required to make cheese."

This can be added to the cheese milk early on in the process, or just prior to maturing."

This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops.

The endangered Ridgway's Rail is also found on the shores of San Francisco Bay, in the cities of Belmont and San Mateo. The endangered wildflower Hickman's potentilla is found near the Pacific Ocean on the lower slopes of Montara Mountain. The endangered wildflowers White-rayed pentachaeta, Pentachaeta bellidiflora, San Mateo Woolly Sunflower, Eriophyllum latilobum, Marin Dwarf Flax, Hesperolinon congestum and the San Mateo Thornmint, Acanthomintha duttonii, are found in the vicinity of the Crystal Springs Reservoir.\n\nIn May 2014, a California condor was spotted near Pescadero, a coastal community south of San Francisco—it was the first California condor spotted in San Mateo County since 1904. The condor, tagged with the number \"597\", and also known as \"Lupine\", is one of 439 condors living in the wild or captivity in California, Baja California and Arizona. The three-year-old female flew more than 100 miles (160 km) north from Pinnacles National Park, in San Benito County, on May 30, and landed on a private, forested property near Pescadero, on the San Mateo County Coast, where it was photographed by a motion-activated wildlife camera. Harold Heath, Professor Emeritus, of Stanford University was responsible for the 1904 sighting, 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the University campus.\n\nPumas (Puma concolor), also known as cougars or mountain lions, roam the county.\n\nTule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) were native to San Mateo County and among the \"favored foods\" of the Ohlone people based on ethnohistoric and archeological evidence there. The discovery of two elk specimens made news in 1962, one a royal elk (royal elk bulls have six tines per antler) from a peat bog excavated in Pacifica's historic Laguna Alta, and now in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology collection. These may date from the time of Spanish settlement. Laguna Alta lay just south of the Interstate 280 and Skyline Boulevard intersection, east of Mussel Rock. The California Academy of Sciences also has an elk skull fragment collected one mile inland from the mouth of Purisima Creek in 1951. Additional coastal elk remains dating from the Middle and Late Periods in Northern California were found in at least five more late Holocene archeological sites in San Mateo County: SMA-115 (Montara State Beach site), SMA-118 (Bean Hollow State Beach site), SMA-244 (Butano Ridge site), SMA-97 (Año Nuevo Creek site) and SMA-218 (Año Nuevo State Reserve site). On the eastern side of the San Francisco Peninsula, elk remains were also unearthed at multiple archaeological sites along San Francisquito Creek.\n\n问题: What are three mammals found within San Mateo County?"

        "content": "背景: Magic realism or magical realism is a style of literary fiction and art. It paints a realistic view of the world while also adding magical elements, often blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Magic realism often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances.: 1–5  Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality. Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.\n\nThe term magic realism is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous, and Matthew Strecher (1999) defines it as \"what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe.\" The term and its wide definition can often become confused, as many writers are categorized as magical realists. The term was influenced by a German and Italian painting style of the 1920s which were given the same name. In The Art of Fiction, British novelist and critic David Lodge defines magic realism: \"when marvellous and impossible events occur in what otherwise purports to be a realistic narrative - is an effect especially associated with contemporary Latin-American fiction (for example the work of the Colombian novelist, Gabriel García Marquez) but it is also encountered in novels from other continents, such as those of Günter Grass, Salman Rushdie and Milan Kundera. All these writers have lived through great historical convulsions and wrenching personal upheavals, which they feel they cannot be adequately represented in a discourse of undisturbed realism\", citing Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting as an exemplar. \" Michiko Kakutani writes that \"The transactions between the extraordinary and the mundane that occur in so much Latin American fiction are not merely a literary technique, but also a mirror of a reality in which the fantastic is frequently part of everyday life.\" Magical realism often mixes history and fantasy, as in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, in which the children born at midnight on August 15, 1947, the moment of India's independence, are telepathically linked.\n\nIrene Guenther (1995) tackles the German roots of the term, and how an earlier magic realist art is related to a later magic realist literature; meanwhile, magical realism is often associated with Latin-American literature, including founders of the genre, particularly the authors Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Rulfo, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Elena Garro, Mireya Robles, Rómulo Gallegos and Arturo Uslar Pietri. In English literature, its chief exponents include Neil Gaiman, Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, Nick Joaquin, and Nicola Barker. In Bengali literature, prominent writers of magic realism include Nabarun Bhattacharya, Akhteruzzaman Elias, Shahidul Zahir, Jibanananda Das and Syed Waliullah. In Japanese literature, one of the most important authors of this genre is Haruki Murakami. In Kannada literature, the writers Shivaram Karanth and Devanur Mahadeva have infused magical realism in their most prominent works. In Polish literature, magic realism is represented by Olga Tokarczuk, the 2018 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature.\n\n问题: Based on the paragraph below, name some authors outside of Latin America who employ magical realism in their work."

That required an influx of troops, military suppliers and building contractors, which would set up a new demand for accommodation, including military hospitals. The abolition of slavery in Washington in 1862 also attracted many freedmen to the city. Except for one attempted invasion by Confederate cavalry leader Jubal Early in 1864, the capital remained impregnable.\n\nWhen Lincoln was assassinated in Ford's Theater in April 1865, thousands flocked into Washington to view the coffin, further raising the profile of the city. The new president, Andrew Johnson, wanted to dispel the funereal atmosphere and organized a program of victory parades, which revived public hopes for the future.\n\n问题: From the passage provided, extract the date when Lincoln was assasinated"

They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some, but not all, aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is the principle of subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually.\n\nAnother notable and unique feature of membership are the commissioners of the European Commission, who are appointed by each of the governments of the member states but do not represent their member state but instead work collectively in the interests of all the member states.\n\nIn the 1950s, six core states founded the EU's predecessor European Communities (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfil the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic government and free-market economy together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which had acceded to the EU's predecessor in 1973, ceased to be an EU member state on 31 January 2020.

The term is based on an ancient saying that presumed black swans did not exist – a saying that became reinterpreted to teach a different lesson after they were discovered in Australia.\n\nThe theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, starting in 2001, to explain:\n\n1. The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.\n2. The non-computability of the probability of consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).\n3. The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and the substantial role of rare events in historical affairs.\n\nTaleb's \"black swan theory\" refers only to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequence and their dominant role in history. Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences.  More technically, in the scientific monograph \"Silent Risk\", Taleb mathematically defines the black swan problem as \"stemming from the use of degenerate metaprobability\".\n\n问题: Who developed the Black Swan theory?"

        "content": "背景: Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.\n\n问题: What are the earliest records of dried fruits in history?"

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe — void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby. Consult a physician for tips and safety recommendations."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "If the bunker is near the pin, use your sand-wedge.  Also, ensure you properly examined the green, to understand its shape and slope.  Combine this with an understanding of your own skill levels to make a decision on where you wish the ball to land.  For example,  the more skilled you are at these shots, the more precise a location you can identify.  Conversely, the less skilled you are, the less precise you can be in your chosen location, and consequently the more you need to consider a range of potential directions.  In those latter cases, it is best to aim towards the middle of the green rather than the exact placement of the pin.  Once you've made a decision on location, go up to your ball in the bunker.  (Pro-tip: don't forget to bring the rake with you).  Choose an open stance, where your legs are aiming roughly 45 degrees more to the left of the selected landing location.  If you're left-handed, the reverse is true, and your legs are aiming to the right of the intended direction/location.  Dig your shoes roughly an inch into the sand, to get a solid footing.  Next, bring your club face down to the ball, without actually touching the sand (it is not legal to make contact with the sand prior to contact with the ball).  Open the club face so that it aims towards the intended location.  Look one more time at the intended direction, then look down at the ball, and commence your backswing.  The plane of your backswing should be out, inline with the direction of your legs, and roughly three quarters the length of a full swing.  Firmly and confidently accelerate in your downswing, and aim to make contact with the sand roughly half an inch behind the ball.  The sand between the ball and the club head will blunt some of the force from the swing, thereby reducing ball travel distance, while still conveying spin.  A well hit shot can cause the ball to land on the green and immediately stop, possibly even moving back in the direction of the player.  The force in the downswing, combined with the amount of sand caught by the club head, are significant contributors to the amount of backspin on the ball.  Once you're done. rake up your marks as you exit the bunker, leaving no trace that you were ever there."

Lasting over the course of three days, it was one of the most prominent battles of both the second Persian invasion of Greece and the wider Greco-Persian Wars.\n\nThe engagement at Thermopylae occurred simultaneously with the Battle of Artemisium: between July and September 480 BC. The second Persian invasion under Xerxes I was a delayed response to the failure of the first Persian invasion, which had been initiated by Darius I and ended in 490 BC by an Athenian-led Greek victory at the Battle of Marathon. By 480 BC, a decade after the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes had amassed a massive land and naval force, and subsequently set out to conquer all of Greece. In response, the Athenian politician and general Themistocles proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae while simultaneously blocking the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.\n\nAround the start of the invasion, a Greek force of approximately 7,000 men led by Leonidas marched north to block the pass of Thermopylae. Ancient authors vastly inflated the size of the Persian army, with estimates in the millions, but modern scholars estimate it at between 120,000 and 300,000 soldiers. They arrived at Thermopylae by late August or early September; the outnumbered Greeks held them off for seven days (including three of direct battle) before their rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the Greeks blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could traverse the narrow pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes revealed to the Persians the existence of a path leading behind the Greek lines. Subsequently, Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked by the Persians, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat along with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians. It has been reported that others also remained, including up to 900 helots and 400 Thebans. With the exception of the Thebans, most of whom reportedly surrendered, the Greeks fought the Persians to the death.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek naval force at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek defensive strategy had required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, the decision was made to withdraw to the island of Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated city of Athens. The Greek fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada—attacked and defeated the invading force at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, reportedly losing many of his troops to starvation and disease while also leaving behind the Persian military commander Mardonius to continue the Achaemenid Empire's Greek campaign. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat Mardonius and his troops at the Battle of Plataea, ending the second Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as a flagship example of the power of an army defending its native soil. The performance of the Greek defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and use of terrain as force multipliers.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about the Battle of Thermopylae, tell me when the battle was fought, who the battle was between, how many Greek and Persian forces there were, how the Persian army was able to flank the Greek forces and who won the battle?"

The Persian army was able to outflank the Greek army because a local person named Ephialtes informed the Persians that there was an unguarded path that lead behind the Greek lines. The Greek army made one final stand but ultimately were unsuccessful and were over taken by the Persian army."

There are three main categories of cross-country ski available: classic, skate and touring, all of which come with specialized types of skies. Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing. Touring skis allows skiers to most easily ski off the trails on top of snow that has not been groomed."

Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels. Al-Kindi's Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages, providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding. Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis.\n\nThe earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt. Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.\n\n问题: Given this reference text about the history of statistics, what was the earliest publican of writing on statistics?"

When a psychoactive drug enters the user's body, it induces an intoxicating effect. Generally, recreational drugs are divided into three categories: depressants (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calmness), stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness), and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).\n\nIn popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour, rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication. However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world. Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, as well as opiates and benzodiazepines. What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. As of 2015, it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged 15 to 65 (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.\n\nCommon recreational drugs include caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate; alcohol, commonly found in beer, wine, cocktails, and distilled spirits; nicotine, commonly found in tobacco, tobacco-based products, and electronic cigarettes; cannabis and hashish (with legality of possession varying inter/intra-nationally); and the controlled substances listed as controlled drugs in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) of the United Nations (UN). Since the early 2000s, the European Union (EU) has developed several comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategies as part of its drug policy in order to prevent the diffusion of recreational drug use and abuse among the European population and raise public awareness on the adverse effects of drugs among all member states of the European Union, as well as conjoined efforts with European law enforcement agencies, such as the Europol and EMCDDA, in order to counter organized crime and illegal drug trade in Europe.\n\n问题: Give me a summary of the paragraph in your own words and it should be short"

        "content": "Recreational drug use refers to using certain drugs for enjoyment or leisure purposes instead of for medicinal reasons. Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.\n\nPeople often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole."

The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million, comprising soldiers, officers and adherents collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\n\nThe theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".\n\nThe Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition. Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.\n\nIn 2011, Charity Watch rated the Salvation Army an \"A−\" to an \"A\", indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency. The Salvation Army has received an A-rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.\n\nThe Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid,[citation needed] with expenditures including operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the fourth largest charity in the United States, with private donations in excess of $2 billion in 2022, and is a member of the American organisation Christian Churches Together.\n\n问题: Can you write me a summary on this page then tell me who and how much traffic is drawn to this page from which regions around the world?"

Five years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC and also the first to be filmed in high definition.\n\nPlanet Earth premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.\n\nPlanet Earth: The Future (2006)\nPlanet Earth: The Future is a 2006 BBC documentary series on the environment and conservation, produced by the BBC Natural History Unit as a companion to the multi-award-winning nature documentary Planet Earth. The programmes were originally broadcast on BBC Four immediately after the final three episodes of Planet Earth on BBC One. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the species and environments featured in Planet Earth, using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of science, conservation, politics, and theology. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley.\n\nSaving Planet Earth (2007)\nSaving Planet Earth is a season of nature documentaries with a conservation theme, screened on BBC Television in 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of its specialist factual department, the BBC Natural History Unit.\n\nThe series featured films contributed by a number of celebrities on the plight of various endangered species, and coincided with the launch of the BBC Wildlife Fund, a charitable organisation which distributes money to conservation projects around the world. The television series culminated in a live fundraising telethon on BBC Two, hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, which raised over £1 million for the charity.\n\nThe BBC broadcast a second live telethon in 2010. Wild Night In was presented by Kate Humble, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games and featured conservation projects which had benefited from the support of the BBC Wildlife Fund. This helped to raise a further £1 million.\n\nPlanet Earth Live (2012)\nPlanet Earth Live is a live action nature documentary screened on British television. Produced by the BBC Natural History Unit and broadcast in May 2012, the programme was presented by Richard Hammond and Julia Bradbury.\n\nPlanet Earth Live featured real-time footage of young animals from five continents throughout the month of May. Broadcast three times per week, teams of nature experts and documentary makers monitored the activity of animals in their area, reporting back on the day’s events. Animals featured included meerkats in the Kalahari Desert, American black bears in Minnesota, lions and African bush elephants in East Africa, toque macaques in Sri Lanka, gray whales off the coast of California, polar bears in Svalbard and giant otters in Peru.\n\nThe programme was shown in May 2012 on BBC One in the United Kingdom and was broadcast in 140 countries in total, making it the most ambitious global wildlife series the BBC had ever undertaken. In the US it was retitled 24/7 Wild and aired on NatGeo Wild; in South Africa, Asia, Australia, Italy, Nordic countries, New Zealand and Poland it was shown on BBC Knowledge; and in India on BBC Entertainment.\n\nPlanet Earth II (2016)\nPlanet Earth II is a natural history documentary series, produced by the BBC as a sequel to the highly successful Planet Earth television series, which aired roughly a decade earlier, in 2006. The series was presented and narrated by Sir David Attenborough with the score composed by Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe first trailer was released on 9 October 2016, and the series was broadcast in November 2016 (United Kingdom) on BBC One and BBC One HD. Planet Earth II is also the first television series that the BBC have produced in Ultra-high-definition (4K).\n\nPlanet Earth III (2023)\nPlanet Earth III will be the third part in the Planet Earth trilogy. It is set to release in 2023.\n\n问题: Extract the names of the Planet Earth series, and separate them with a comma."

        "content": "背景: C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced \"C plus plus\") is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\n\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\n\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.\n\n问题: From the passage provided, extract the year where C++ was standardized"

        "content": "背景: Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.\n\nMost buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.\n\nIn the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture.\n\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century, and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century. The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).\n\nThe next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\". Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".\n\n\nThe most famous Budapest bridge, the Chain Bridge, the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.\n\nThe Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the Sándor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge. Budapest's two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.\n\n\nThe Hungarian Parliament, completed in 1904\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations. Art Nouveau in Hungary (Szecesszió in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.\n\nIt is one of the world's outstanding urban landscapes and illustrates the great periods in the history of the Hungarian capital.\n\nUNESCO\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelház), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.\n\n问题: From the text provided, extract the list of styles found on Budapest architecture. Separate them with a semi-colon."

For brining and during the cooking process most chefs and cooks will choose to only use kosher salt due to it’s flake size and consistency across recipes but they will typically choose one particular brand and stick with it.

While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet from the tomato sauce and of course added complexities from whichever toppings you choose.

Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals – which companies are – and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."

        "content": "In grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or PoS, also known as word class or grammatical category) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes similar morphological behavior in that they undergo inflection for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior. Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, and determiner.\n\nAlmost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages. For example:\n\nJapanese has as many as three classes of adjectives, where English has one.\nChinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers.\nMany languages do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs.\nBecause of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria"

        "content": "Throughout history ‘what makes a good teacher?’ has constantly been questioned by both parents and children. Many consider a good teacher to be one who is caring, helpful, yet also strict when necessary. \n One book that focuses on what makes a good teacher is Our day out, by Willy Russel. The book provided people in the 1970s with a perspective on what both children and parents were looking for, inspiring many British teachers. According to Russel, a good teacher cares for the learning of their students and demonstrates it. If a teacher does not demonstrate caring behavior, their students will sense it. Carol, one of the students says to Mr.Briggs “Don't lie, you! I know you hate me. I've seen you goin' home in your car, passin' us on the street. You hate all the kids.” (Russell 48). Carol believes that Mr. Briggs does not care about his students, even though he does as shown earlier in the book: “Briggs: What? About you? Listen ... if I didn't care, why am I here, now, trying to stop you doing something stupid.” (Russell 48). Mr Briggs believes that caring for students implies also disciplining them at times. “Listen, I'm not going to spend any more time arguing with you. You may have organized this visit, but I'm the one who's been sent by the Headmaster to supervise. Now, either you take control of the children in your charge or I'll be forced to abandon this visit and order everyone home.” Thus, even if a teacher cares about their students, they should demonstrate it. Opinions from students of different ages will help further illustrate the image of a good teacher. \nMany people think that a good teacher is primarily kind and loving.  However, through multiple interviews it appeared to be only partially true. A good teacher, according to most students, is not overly kind and should apply discipline when needed. For example, 12 year old Monon Mukherjee said that he looks for guidance and ability to teach in a teacher. On the other hand, 40 year old Bilal Aslam looks for discipline and ability to teach. 42 year old Cristian Molina also agrees with the need for discipline, however he also expects teachers to feel an urge to help students no matter who they are. The book and the interviews intersect in many ways. They both highlight the importance of kindness, caring for learning, and teacher’s ability to discipline. However, they also differ in important ways. In the book, teachers were encouraged to be kind and apply discipline when necessary, but through the interviews it has been shown that providing help and guidance are also expected in a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, a good teacher cares about their students' learning, is prepared to help them, yet also disciplines them when necessary. A good teacher should feel an urge to teach students and guide them through the complex path of life."

They have been referred to as Germany's most successful pop duo, and have had a number of hit singles, reaching the top five in many countries. Their most popular singles are \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\", \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\", \"Brother Louie\", \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\" and \"Geronimo's Cadillac\".\nModern Talking worked together from 1983 to 1987, then the band disbanded. In 1998, they reunited and made a successful comeback, recording and releasing music from 1998 to 2003. The duo released singles (many of which involved American rapper Eric Singleton) which again entered the top ten in Germany and abroad, one of which was the re-recorded version of \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98\". After the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, their global sales had reached 120 million singles and albums combined.\n\n问题: what is Modern Talking?"

        "content": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"Déjà vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998–2003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."

Target 3.2 is \"by 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce … under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\"Child mortality rates have decreased in the last 40 years. While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children, and then in 2020, the global number fell again to 5 million. Rapid progress has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990, with the global under-5 mortality rate declining by over half between 1990 and 2016. While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children. However, despite advances, there are still 15,000 under-five deaths per day from largely preventable causes. About 80 per cent of these occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and just 6 countries account for half of all under-five deaths: China, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 45% of these children died during the first 28 days of life. Death rates were highest among children under age 1, followed by children ages 15 to 19, 1 to 4, and 5 to 14.\n\n问题: From the passage identify the different types of mortality encompassed by Child mortality.

Complications may include amyloidosis.\n\nThe cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Risk factors include obesity, radiation exposure, family history, and certain chemicals. There is an increased risk of multiple myeloma in certain occupations. This is due to the occupational exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents having a role in causation of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma may develop from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance that progresses to smoldering myeloma. The abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal antibodies, which can cause kidney problems and overly thick blood. The plasma cells can also form a mass in the bone marrow or soft tissue. When one tumor is present, it is called a plasmacytoma; more than one is called multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed based on blood or urine tests finding abnormal antibodies, bone marrow biopsy finding cancerous plasma cells, and medical imaging finding bone lesions.

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."

The mobile phones can also provide some useful educational resources (if used under supervision). Also kids can entertain themselves with a mobile device. Depending on the ages and also other more specific situations, mobile devices can also have very negative impact to their growth and well-being. For example kids may get addicted to video games and social media. Both can have very harmful contents if they are not being monitored carefully. Mobile phones can also easily distract children from their other tasks such as homework or sleep. Another important factor is safety. Mobile devices are subject to be exploited and hacked by bad actors and children are not mature nor knowledgable enough to be aware of this kind of dangers or risks. There are cases or incidents involving mobile devices that have caused young kids grave harms and serious consequences."

They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins."

Kerrie Ann meets an elderly neighbour when she's young, Mrs Ivanovich, an entomologist who teaches Kerrie about life, death, the Amazon rainforest and the miniature, alien world of insects. \"Kez\" struggles to look after her brother Jon, and hold things together as she's brought up by her junkie mum, Sue, and later, living with her boyfriend Mark as he becomes more and more involved with heroin and crack cocaine.\n\nThe book explores themes of metamorphosis, the highs and lows of drugs, and how people become trapped by poisoned environments, and what it takes to escape them.\n\nMonaghan was included in The Independent's New Year list of \"Rising Talent of 2006\" and The Killing Jar made their 50 Hot Books for summer and Books of Year features. It went on to win a Betty Trask Award, The Authors' Club Best First Novel Award, and the Waverton Good Read Award.\n\n问题: Based on the provided text, how many awards did the book \"The Killing Jar\" win and what year were they awarded?"

The largest universe market cap for a sci fi universe is Star Wars created by George Lucas and all its canon. Star Wars at its core story is about an all binding energy called the force which bound the galaxy together which a few people could harness its power.  Its a classic story of good vs evil paired with amazing special effects to give the viewer an immersive believable universe.  One of the longest running Sci Fi Series with a cult following was Stargate SG-1 which aired for 10 seasons and had two movies created.    Stargate SG-1 is about a network of inter-planetary gates that allowed for anyone to instantaneously travel between entire different planets.  The saga is ripe with discovering new cultures in foreign planets, intermixed with long story arcs about formidable foes and a team with a very diverse set of people and aliens battling for good of the galaxy.  Stargate SG-1 had amazing character development over its 10 season course which made it a great fan favorite.  The 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica is an epic story of artificial intelligence versus humanity.  Humanity is being hunted and on the brink of all out extinction.  Its a war-time classic that explores the factors that make us human, what a society is about, and survival."

Your anger will see its waves. Your voice is commanding and demanding. Your eyes spew anger. Every action of yours is wrong till you sit and calm yourself and analyse what you are going through and why. \nAs much as you want to get it over, the more it will haunt you in your later years. You will long for those happy moments, those hugs and kisses, where everything under the sun was perfect and just like how you had envisioned, but it is all gone.

This can include things like strength training, yoga (flexibility) and cardio (swimming, running, etc). \n\n2) Get a breadth of experience: It is helpful to get competency in the various specialties that are found in MMA fights so you can adequately handle all styles that may be employed at the time.  At a high level, this can be split into two sections: \n    - Striking: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training is Boxing, Kickboxing, Muai-Thai. \n    - Grappling: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training in is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Freestyle Wresting. \n\n3) Consider specializing: While it is good to have a breadth of different techniques, really honing in on one sub-discipline can give you an edge in comparison to other fighters. For example, Khabib Nurmagomedov has found success with a wrestling base. \n\n\nThese are just some starting points to consider when thinking about becoming a professional MMA athlete. Soft Skills like networking and marketing are also very important once you reach more professional levels of the sport."

Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939. Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA), the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). They provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth, and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe programs focused on what historians refer to as the \"3 R's\": relief for the unemployed and for the poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in progressive ideas, the South, big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions, and various ethnic groups. The Republicans were split, with progressive Republicans in support but conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth. The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964.\n\n问题: Given the reference text about \"The New Deal\", what are the \"3 R's\" historians refer to about the program."

For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days. The odds are measured as the number of events divided by the number of non-events. To contrast, probability would be the number of events divided by the sum of events and non-events."

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The film also features Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, Cameron's direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases since 1997 have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.249 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). It was also selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2017 for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n问题: Which was the first film to reach he billion-dollar mark?"

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?"

Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is always held at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private course in the city of Augusta, Georgia, in the southeastern United States.\n\nThe Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\n问题: What is the Masters Tournament?"

Bobby Fischer is well-known for winning the \"Game of the Century\" at the age of 13 and, as an adult, won 20 consecutive games against some of the best chess players in the world. Gary Kasparov was the number one rated chess player for over 20 years and was World Chess Champion for 15 consecutive years.

A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimović is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s."

The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.\n\n问题: Extract from the following passage, the periods of time does sunrise refer to."

Banking services which are regarded as retail include provision of savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. Retail banking is also distinguished from investment banking or commercial banking. It may also refer to a division or department of a bank which deals with individual customers.\n\nIn the U.S., the term commercial bank is used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the Great Depression, the Glass–Steagall Act restricted normal banks to banking activities, and investment banks to capital market activities. That distinction was repealed in the 1990s. Commercial bank can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that deals mostly with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to individual members of the public (retail banking)."

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\""

        "content": "背景: Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\n\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\n\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of \"America's Pastime\"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\n问题: What is the objective of a batter in the sport of baseball?"

The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base."

There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BC. The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period.\n\nBuddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century AD.\n\nIn 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king’s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King’s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa’s reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress. Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.\n\n问题: Who built Sigiriya fortress in Sri Lanka?"

The white clapboarded wood-frame structure was built in 1837 for a congregation formed two years earlier. It is one of the older buildings in Osterville, and is a fine example of the Greek Revival with Gothic Revival elements. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Osterville Baptist Church is set prominently in the center of Osterville on the north side of the junction of Main Street and Wianno Avenue. It is rectangular single-story wood-frame structure, with a gable roof, vinyl siding, and a brick foundation. Its exterior features a mix of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival styling, with corner paneled pilasters rising to entablatures running along the sides of the building, and lancet-arched panels above its windows. Its facade is symmetrically arranged, with a pair of entrances, each framed by sidelight windows and pilasters, with an entablature and cornice on top, and sash windows above. A single lancet-arch panel adorns the center of the gable end. The church has a two-stage square tower, with a plain first stage topped by a belfry with lancet-arched louvered openings, and a steeple above.\n\nThe church congregation was organized in 1835 as the Second Barnstable Baptist Church, and this church was dedicated in 1838, having been built on land given by Captain George Lovell. Its steeple is a reconstruction of the original, which was lost in a hurricane in 1945. The church interior was remodeled in 1889, at which time a heating system was added. Further additions have been made to the rear of the building, adding classroom, meeting, and office spaces.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about the Osterville Baptist Church, tell me why its steeple was rebuilt and when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singers and songwriters.\n\n问题: According to the passage, mention some of Taylor’s early albums."

I-95 was made a continuous freeway in 2018, and thus I-70 remains the only original Interstate with a discontinuity.\n\nI-95 was discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway. This situation was remedied when the construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project started in 2010 and partially opened on September 22, 2018, which was already enough to fill the gap.\n\nHowever, I-70 remains discontinuous in Pennsylvania, because of the lack of a direct interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the eastern end of the concurrency near Breezewood. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of US-30 (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls. Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph, which two US interstates were not originally continuous?

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "In Nietzsche’s, “On the Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense” Nietzsche explains his attitude towards human scientific knowledge with great skepticism, even alluding to humans as “the most arrogant and mendacious” creations (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). This same sort of criticism is brought up in the concept of “the god-trick” in Haraway’s, “Situated Knowledge: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective.” Haraway explains this concept as an illusion within which humans compare their own knowledge to the idea of infinite knowledge to that of a god. This sort of intellectual superiority has been a long-standing concept in human history as we have progressed in scientific thought. Described initially in Haraway’s writing, “the god-trick” remerges in many ideas Nietzsche exemplifies this through various metaphors and explanations of biases through perceptions.\nThis idea of the “the god-trick” and its qualities of knowing all, stem from humans and their rigid minds, being able to grasp only at what is tangible in their own minds, consequently shutting out other perspectives. Humans approach scientific discovery with a biased view, through their own one-sided viewpoint, and through no fault of their own make scientific discoveries which come from their own observations. But it isn't at this point where human faults are exemplified, Nietzsche argues, rather when scientific discovery is built upon these so-called\n “scientific truths.” It is at this point in time where in a moment notice the concept of science could “swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff” because of the very construct of scientific advancement based on falsities (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). Yet, given the knowledge of how fallible so many human discoveries have the potential to be, we still hold on to the idea of superior credibility which can be challenged by no force in our world, in essence, what Haraway refers to. In her idea of the “the god-trick,” Haraway advocates for a different way we approach observations through a different approach to objectivity. In separating ourselves from the almost seemingly personal obligation of being able to understand anything and everything and accepting the complexities of science we are able to remove the idea of false compromise on scientific truths to make up for our lack of understanding.\nA fundamental idea that is exemplified in Nietzsche’s writing, is the idea of pride. Pride is a large component of human behavior and many actions are justified. The concept of pride can even be seen as an answer to the implied questions of where the root of the “god-trick” is derived from. From the beginning of time, it can be observed that we humans have had an itch for the idea of conquering. An itch to conquer societies, cultures, land, or even something as simple as higher socioeconomic status. It's quite simply in our blood and has been present for generations of humans. Furthering Haraway’s argument, Nietzsche presents the idea of how being prideful in the depth of our “knowledgeable” we are “blinding fog over the eyes and senses of men'' exemplifying how pride can produce scientific thought that provides answers just for the sake of answering questions that in reality are faulty (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). As a result of this, a curtain of deception is created in which humans have assisted in the creation\n\nof their lies which to them have been converted into truth. Scientific discovery from this point on leads to “truth” being built upon from lies.\nTurning a blind eye is a large theme within the idea of “the god-trick” and is iterated upon in Nietzsche’s description of the “leaf.” The leaf is a broad example of this created by “disregarding... differences and forgetting distinguishing aspects” (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 24). What is described here is that humans cannot label an \"essential quality\" for anything they describe. In essence, it is understood that there are many different types of leaves but we are not able to explain the explicit differences among them and in doing so what arises is a lack of “truth'' with the leaf. The fault lies in the generalization of the leaf and applying this generalization to other contexts is where the fault lies, which is exactly what Haraway addresses in her “god-trick” illusion. The very definition of “the god-trick” includes generalizing our own knowledge to compensate for the holes in our discovery and knowledge.\nThrough years of scientific advancement and gain in understanding our world, the so-called truths that humans have established may have faults resulting from the way the scientific method approaches them. Haraway suggests that our way of utilizing objectivity needs to reworked to be more inclusive and Nietzsche’s writings extend upon this idea and exemplify how these truths may have fault in them as a result of assumptions. These assumptions built on top of each other lead to the lack of understanding that both authors argue."

This approach focuses on building a pack structure in the home where the humans are seen as higher in the pecking order than the dogs in the home.  Examples include leading at all times (ie through doorways and walks), and only allowing your dog to eat after you’ve finished dinner and using training aids like a shock/vibration collar to enforce behaviors. \n\nIn recent years, many experts have recommended a positive reinforcement based training approach.  Although there are a lot of nuances, at its core this method uses rewards to guide your dog towards desired behaviors. Positive reinforcement training typically means using a signal (like a word or a noise) combined with training treats, loved toys or verbal praise to reinforce good behaviors or actions. Other benefits include strengthening the relationship between owner and dog and building a happy training environment."

        "content": "Dear Mum and Dad,\n\nAs you know, I have wanted a pet tortoise for some time now. I have given it a lot of thought and done a great deal of research into what might be involved. I am aware that having a pet is a huge commitment so I am writing to you to explain why I think you should buy me a pet tortoise and why a tortoise is a fantastic choice of pet.\n\nLooking after a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility. I know that I will have to ensure my tortoise is well fed, kept at the right temperature, given opportunities to bask under a heated lamp or in the sunshine if warm enough. I am very willing to give the time and commitment necessary to look after my tortoise. The tortoise will be my sole responsibility and I feel mature enough to commit to its care and happiness.\n\nAs you know, I suffer from anxiety and school makes me particularly worried sometimes. It has been shown through numerous studies that pets reduce anxiety and stress in humans. I feel sure that having a tortoise will be a fantastic distraction from my worries and bring me great enjoyment. Contrary to popular belief, tortoises love having their shells stroked and their chins tickled and I think it would be very relaxing for me to pet a tortoise when I get home from school.\n\nTortoises are very self-sufficient. Provided they are given a warm place to bask, access to fresh water and plenty of fresh food such as dandelions, kale, lettuce and other leafy vegetables, they are very happy to be left to their own devices. As we live in the UK where temperatures can be cool, we would need to purchase a tortoise table with good substrate, a basking lamp and some hides where the tortoise can tuck itself away. We have lots of space for this in our kitchen. When it is warm, the tortoise can go into our garden in an enclosure. A tortoise table and lamp will cost about £200 but this is just an initial outlay. Thereafter, keeping a tortoise is very cheap. In fact, you can pick most of their food for free by foraging which I am happy to do when we go for families walk.\n\nContrary to popular belief, tortoises can be very friendly. As I have mentioned above, they love being stroked but did you also know that they can recognise their owners and some can even respond to their names? In fact, a study showed that tortoises can recognise their previous owners that they haven’t seen in years so they are both friendly and very intelligent.\nYou might be worried about hibernating a tortoise but I have done lots of research on this and now know exactly what to do. If we buy a tortoise, it will need to hibernate for a maximum of three months from the end of September. We will need to hibernate our tortoise in a well-insulated box. The temperature mustn’t go above or below 5 degrees celsius and our garage would be the perfect place for it. We have a temperature gauge in there so I can keep an eye on the heat levels. \n\nFinally, I have looked into the cost of buying a tortoise. I would suggest we buy a tortoise which is a couple of years’ old as they require less care. We can buy a preloved tortoise which has been microchipped for about £100. And when we go on holiday, I have found a Tortoise Hotel which is run by a vet and costs just £60 for a 10 day stay.\n\nI think you will agree that I have conducted very thorough research into looking after a tortoise and I hope you will agree that I am now mature enough to look after a pet. I truly believe that a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility and will have a positive calming effect on my mood. Indeed, I think the whole family will enjoy having a tortoise. They are friendly, loving, interesting and intelligent animals and we will all benefit from having one.\n\nI would be grateful if you would give my request full consideration.\n\nLots of Love,\n\nWilf x"

        "content": "背景: Vehicle types\nIn North America (US and Canada), there are four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis-cab with a custom rear compartment that is often referred to as a \"box\" or \"module.\" Type I ambulances are primarily used for Advanced Life Support (ALS), also referred to as Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in some jurisdictions, and rescue work. A Type II ambulance is based on a commercial heavy-duty van with few modifications except for a raised roof and a secondary air conditioning unit for the rear of the vehicle. These types of ambulances are primarily used for Basic Life Support (BLS) and transfer of patients but it is not uncommon to find them used for advanced life support and rescue. Type III is a van chassis-cab but with a custom-made rear compartment and has the same uses as Type I ambulances. Type IV is for smaller ad hoc patient transfer that use smaller utility vehicles in which passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds; they generally do not fall under Federal Regulations.\n\nAmbulances can be based on many types of vehicle although emergency and disaster conditions may lead to other vehicles serving as makeshift ambulances:\n\n\nA modern American ambulance built on the chassis of a Ford F-450 truck, with extensive external storage\n\nMany modern Canadian and European ambulances are built on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis. Some, like this Niagara Region example, use custom rear compartments.\nVan or pickup truck – A typical general-purpose ambulance is based on either the chassis of a van (vanbulance) or a light-duty truck. This chassis is then modified to the designs and specifications of the purchaser. Vans may either retain their original body and be upfitted inside, or may be based on a chassis without the original body with a modular box body fitted instead. Those based on pickup trucks almost always have modular bodies. Those vehicles intended for especially intensive care or require a large amount of equipment to be carried may be based on medium-duty trucks.\nCar – Used either as a fly-car for rapid response or to transport patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted to the requirements of the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as these were some of the few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position. Some operators use modular-body transport ambulances based on the chassis of a minivan and station wagon.\nMotorcycle and motor scooter – In urban areas, these may be used for rapid response in an emergency as they can travel through heavy traffic much faster than a car or van. Trailers or sidecars can make these patient transporting units. See also motorcycle ambulance.\n\nPatient being loaded into a medical helicopter\nBicycle – Used for response, but usually in pedestrian-only areas where large vehicles find access difficult. Like the motorcycle ambulance, a bicycle may be connected to a trailer for patient transport, most often in the developing world. See also cycle responder.\nAll-terrain vehicle (ATV) – for example quad bikes; these are used for response off-road, especially at events. ATVs can be modified to carry a stretcher, and are used for tasks such as mountain rescue in inaccessible areas.\n\nGolf Cart converted into an ambulance\nGolf cart or Neighborhood Electric Vehicle – Used for rapid response at events or on campuses. These function similarly to ATVs, with less rough terrain capability, but with less noise.\nHelicopter – Usually used for emergency care, either in places inaccessible by road, or in areas where speed is of the essence, as they are able to travel significantly faster than a road ambulance. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.\nFixed-wing aircraft – These can be used for either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.\nBoat – Boats can be used to serve as ambulances, especially in island areas or in areas with a large number of canals, such as the Venetian water ambulances. Some lifeboats or lifeguard vessels may fit the description of an ambulance as they are used to transport a casualty.\nBus – In some cases, buses can be used for multiple casualty transport, either for the purposes of taking patients on journeys, in the context of major incidents, or to deal with specific problems such as drunken patients in town centres. Ambulance buses are discussed at greater length in their own article.\nTrailer – In some instances a trailer, which can be towed behind a self-propelled vehicle can be used. This permits flexibility in areas with minimal access to vehicles, such as on small islands.\nHorse and cart – Especially in developing world areas, more traditional methods of transport include transport such as horse and cart, used in much the same way as motorcycle or bicycle stretcher units to transport to a local clinic.\nFire engine – Fire services (especially in North America) often train firefighters to respond to medical emergencies and most apparatuses carry at least basic medical supplies. By design, most apparatuses cannot transport patients unless they can sit in the cab.\n\n问题: Please write a summary of the kinds of vehicles that are used for ambulances."

The point at which these layers meet is called an interface, and is where slipping or sliding of one layer on top of another is most likely to occur. This occurrence is what can trigger an avalanche. Snow conditions on a slope can also evolve over time with wind and sun and other weather patterns, so even a once-safe slope might increase in risk under certain conditions.

As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide (Easter season).

Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard."

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today."

During times when the economy is doing incredibly well, a.k.a. running hot or facing inflation (rise of prices of goods and services), the Federal Reserve will need to reduce the supply of money by increasing the cost of borrowing.  \n\nThe primary lever to increase the cost of borrowing is by increasing the Federal Funds rate (the rate for banks to borrow and lend their excess reserves to meet liquidity requirements). Increasing the Federal Funds rate results in more expensive borrowing costs, which can reduce demand among banks to borrow money.  Less money is borrowed to help fund the economy resulting in a reduction in purchasing power and the money supply.  This will slow down the pace of economic growth and help ease inflation."

The unique, natural\ndesign of the house and the stunning and spacious lot provide both an immediately\ncomfortable home with room to grow over the years. We look forward to building out\nthe garage with a woodworking shop, setting up the artist shed on the river as a\npottery studio, cooking meals for friends and family in the wonderful\nkitchen, and finding a perfect spot in the yard for a vegetable garden.\n\nWe want to care and tend this home much as you have for the years you have lived\nhere, and we sincerely appreciate being considered as the next owners of this beautiful\nproperty."

        "content": "背景: At the 1932 Plenipotentiary Telegraph Conference and the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Madrid, the two organizations decided to merge to form the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). They defined telecommunication as \"any telegraphic or telephonic communication of signs, signals, writing, facsimiles and sounds of any kind, by wire, wireless or other systems or processes of electric signaling or visual signaling (semaphores).\"\n\nThe definition was later reconfirmed, according to Article 1.3 of the Radio Regulations (RR), telecommunication, which defined it as \"Any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical, or other electromagnetic systems\".\n\nBeacons and pigeons\n\nA replica of one of Chappe's semaphore towers\nHoming pigeons have been used throughout history by different cultures. Pigeon post had Persian roots and was later used by the Romans to aid their military. Frontinus claimed Julius Caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of Gaul. The Greeks also conveyed the names of the victors at the Olympic Games to various cities using homing pigeons. In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in Java and Sumatra. And in 1849, Paul Julius Reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as \"the enemy has been sighted\" had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable instance of their use was during the Spanish Armada, when a beacon chain relayed a signal from Plymouth to London.\n\nIn 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, built the first fixed visual telegraphy system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.\n\nTelegraph and telephone\nOn July 25, 1837, the first commercial electrical telegraph was demonstrated by English inventor Sir William Fothergill Cooke and English scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone. Both inventors viewed their device as \"an improvement to the  electromagnetic telegraph\" and not as a new device.\n\nSamuel Morse independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on September 2, 1837. His code was an important advance over Wheatstone's signaling method. The first transatlantic telegraph cable was successfully completed on July 27, 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time.\n\nThe conventional telephone was patented by Alexander Bell in 1876. Elisha Gray also filed a caveat for it in 1876. Gray abandoned his caveat and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had filed his caveat for the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to document the idea and test it in a telephone. Antonio Meucci invented a device that allowed the electrical transmission of voice over a line nearly 30 years before in 1849, but his device was of little practical value because it relied on the electrophonic effect requiring users to place the receiver in their mouths to \"hear.\" The first commercial telephone services were set up by the Bell Telephone Company in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of New Haven and London.\n\nRadio and television\nIn 1894, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began developing a wireless communication using the then-newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves, showing by 1901 that they could be transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean. This was the start of wireless telegraphy by radio. On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1904, a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which incorporated them into their onboard newspapers.\n\nWorld War I accelerated the development of radio for military communications. After the war, commercial radio AM broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. World War II again accelerated the development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation, and radar. Development of stereo FM broadcasting of radio began in the 1930s in the United States and the 1970s in the United Kingdom, displacing AM as the dominant commercial standard.\n\nOn March 25, 1925, John Logie Baird demonstrated the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus became known as the mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning on 30 September 1929. However, for most of the 20th century, televisions depended on the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, interrupted experiments resumed and television became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.\n\nThermionic valves\nThe type of device known as a thermionic tube or thermionic valve uses thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode for a number of fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current rectification.\n\nThe simplest vacuum tube, the diode invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming, contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Electrons can only flow in one direction through the device—from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more control grids within the tube enables the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids. These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the 20th century and were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, sound recording and reproduction, long-distance telephone networks, and analogue and early digital computers. While some applications had used earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter for radio or mechanical computers for computing, it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical, leading to the creation of electronics.\n\nIn the 1940s, the invention of semiconductor devices made it possible to produce solid-state devices, which are smaller, cheaper, and more efficient, reliable, and durable than thermionic tubes. Starting in the mid-1960s, thermionic tubes were replaced with the transistor. Thermionic tubes still have some applications for certain high-frequency amplifiers.\n\nComputer networks and the Internet\nOn 11 September 1940, George Stibitz transmitted problems for his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype and received the computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. In the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting the beginnings of the ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comments documents, other networking advancements occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and Token Ring (1984)[citation needed].\n\nGrowth of transmission capacity\nThe effective capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes (pB) of optimally compressed information in 1986 to 471 pB in 1993 to 2.2 exabytes (eB) in 2000 to 65 eB in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages per person per day in 1986, and six entire newspapers per person per day by 2007. Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the world economy and the global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n问题: Give me a list of the key elements of telecommunications developed over time"

I saw that it was going into a nearby parking lot that was on my way so I pulled over. I got out of my car and carefully walked up to the puppy to see if it had a tag or any identification. Suddenly, I saw a shadow pass behind me and someone grabbed me from behind and tried to wrestle my keys away from me.\nToo bad for him, he didn't realize that I'm a UFC champion.

It is the homeland of the Tibetan people. Also resident on the plateau are some other ethnic groups such as the Monpa, Tamang, Qiang, Sherpa and Lhoba peoples and, since the 20th century, considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui settlers. Since the 1951 annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China, the entire plateau has been under the administration of the People's Republic of China. Tibet is divided administratively into the Tibet Autonomous Region, and parts of the Qinghai and Sichuan provinces.Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 4,380 m (14,000 ft). Located in the Himalayas, the highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848.86 m (29,032 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century. At its height in the 9th century, the Tibetan Empire extended far beyond the Tibetan Plateau, from the Tarim Basin and Pamirs in the west, to Yunnan and Bengal in the southeast. It then divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.\n\n问题: How big is the Tibetan plateau?"

Don't expect the cat to approach you immediately.  Put the treat on the ground and sit nearby.  Be careful not to stare at the cat since that is an aggressive gesture.  If the cat takes the treat, try throwing or laying out another treat, this time a bit closer to you.  Repeat until the cat is nearby.  It will learn to associate you with happiness (food)."

He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John \"Chubby\" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname \"Jellybean\". Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.\n\nBryant started playing basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made.  Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. From 1987 to 1989, his father played for Olimpia Basket Pistoia where he paired with former Detroit Pistons Leon Douglas. Kobe would work at the games as a ball and mop boy and would practice shooting at halftime, with Douglas sharing, \"At every one of our games at halftime, it was the Kobe show. He'd get out there and get his shot up. We'd come out of the locker room at halftime and have to chase him off the court\".\n\nBryant also learned to play soccer, and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league. When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.\n\n问题: Please give me a short bulleted list of the key events that happened in Kobe Bryant’s early life in time order, from earliest to the latest."

Its total height is 165 m (541 feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.\n\nIt is located 7.7 km from Terni, a provincial capital of the Italian region of Umbria. \n\nIts source is a portion of the waters of the river Velino. After flowing through Piediluco lake near the community of Marmore (italian), it pours into the valley below formed by the river Nera. The flow of the waterfall depends on an off and on scale with a published schedule to support the power company nearby.\n\nMost of the time, the water in the canals above the Cascata delle Marmore falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below.\n\nNormally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.\n\nA path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls. Along the way, a tunnel leads to an observatory just next to the falls, where a visitor is likely to get soaked. Another observatory near the top affords a wide view of the falls and of the Nera valley below.\n\n问题: Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary of how turist visit the falls even if they are used for hydroelectric power production."

The creators even introduced new ideas in filming the scenes like using multiple cameras at different angles to create some of the mind-blowing action scenes. The cast also did a great job. I've watched some behind the scenes and noticed how much effort all of them had put to create the best and believable scenes. \nBut the most interesting part of the Matrix movie for me is its subject. It is about a virtual world created and controlled by computers which simulates the life and creates the illusionary perception for the humans that they are really living, but in fact it is only their minds that are the habitants of this world and their real bodies are imprisoned in incubators and are being utilized at energy sources by the computers. I really like the idea and also how one can generalize it to the real world that we are living in. What if this world and the life on it is just a projection or a shadow of a higher form of life, like a two-dimensional shadow of a three-dimensional object in space."

So basically, there’s this idea that there could be lots of different universes happening at the same time, and there are couple of evidences that make people think it might be true.\n\nThere are couple of evidences for parallel universe, such as Hawking radiation, which says that anything going into a black hole might end up in another universe. or the gravity waves act oddly and deviate objects from their orbits, possibly due to the influence of parallel universes.\n\nThis idea of multiple universes has been proposed in various fields of science, including physics, astronomy, and even psychology. For example, Stephen Hawking was the leading theoretical physicist who advocated multiverse theory. I believe it remains a highly theoretical concept till today, and it is an area of active research and exploration, as scientists continue to investigate the possibility of parallel universes and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe and our place in it."

Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics. In the time since Newton, the conceptual content of classical physics has been reformulated in alternative ways, involving different mathematical approaches that have yielded insights which were obscured in the original, Newtonian formulation. Limitations to Newton's laws have also been discovered; new theories are necessary when objects move at very high speeds (special relativity), are very massive (general relativity), or are very small (quantum mechanics).\n\n问题: What are the 3 laws of motion that Newton defined?"

For example, suppose your mind is filled with greed, evil thoughts like harming another person, and jealousy. In that case, it reflects restlessness as we will never be satisfied, punishments for harming another person, and stress to become like someone else, respectively. For a positive example, a life lived with generosity, righteousness, kindness, and genuinely putting good out there will lead to respect in society and a fulfilled life. Furthermore, Buddhism believes in reincarnation. So the good acts and deeds that one puts in this life, one also reaps the benefits in the next life. Therefore, the equation of Karma is relatively straightforward. Do good and work for the betterment of society and oneself."

        "content": "背景: Controversies\n\nIgnoring and evading local regulations\nUber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is \"a technology company\" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber's strategy was generally to \"seek forgiveness rather than permission\". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy. Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber's policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.\n\nIn March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called \"Greyball\" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017. A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a \"panic button\" system, codenamed \"Ripley\", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.\n\nCounter-intelligence research on class action plaintiffs\nIn 2016 Uber hired the global security consulting firm Ergo to secretly investigate plaintiffs involved in a class action lawsuit. Ergo operatives posed as acquaintances of the plaintiff's counsel and tried to contact their associates to obtain information that could be used against them. The result of which was found out causing the judge to throw out evidence obtained as obtained in a fraudulent manner.\n\nSexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)\nOn February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was alleged to have been aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to \"dig up dirt\" on the personal lives and backgrounds of journalists who reported negatively on Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.\n\nDelayed disclosure of data breaches\nOn February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.\n\nAn announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers' license information. Hackers used employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a \"credential stuffing\" method) to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber's developers. The hackers located credentials for the company's Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data. Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach. Khosrowshahi publicly apologized. In September 2018, in the largest multi-state settlement of a data breach, Uber paid $148 million to the Federal Trade Commission, admitted that its claim that internal access to consumers' personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false, and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data. Also in November 2018, Uber's British divisions were fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the Information Commissioner's Office.\n\nIn 2020, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against former Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan for obstruction of justice. The criminal complaint said Sullivan arranged, with Kalanick's knowledge, to pay a ransom for the 2016 breach as a \"bug bounty\" to conceal its true nature, and for the hackers to falsify non-disclosure agreements to say they had not obtained any data.\n\n问题: Provide a bulleted list of the controversies regarding Uber and a brief summary of each"

        "content": "背景: The Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick, who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI, in 2000. Their new home field, Gillette Stadium, opened in 2002 to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Long–time starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was the franchise's star throughout the 1990s, went down with a sheared blood vessel in his chest in a week two match–up in 2001 against the rival New York Jets. Backup quarterback Tom Brady, drafted by the Patriots in sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, became the starting quarterback. Brady's successful play led to Bledsoe never getting his job back as a starter, and would serve as the franchise's starting quarterback for the next 18 years. Under Belichick and Brady, the Patriots became one of the most consistently dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"dynasty\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons (2001, 2003, and 2004), over the St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. The Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16–0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games. After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19–0 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18–1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18–1 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants, 21–17. In 2014, the Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title. After Seattle had driven the ball to New England's 1-yard line with under a minute to go, New England rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler made a critical interception on Seattle's final offensive play that helped to seal the victory. New England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016–17 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Losing 28–3 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory. The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017–18 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII, where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history.\n\n问题: Based on this passage, which years did the Patriots win the Super Bowl?"

For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the “value curve” for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, think of “AI/ML” as the thinking and “Intelligent Automation” as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation."

The name Beijing, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 for north and 京 for capital), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\"). The English spelling Beijing is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, Peking(北平 in Chinese meaning), was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655. Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA Code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about the history of Beijing, when did Beijing get the current name?"

It is composed of a statue representing the goddess Niké (Victory), whose head and arms are missing, and its base in the shape of a ship's bow.\n\nThe total height of the monument is 5.57 meters including the socle; the statue alone measures 2.75 meters.

For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately by conditioning it relative to their age, rather than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.\n\nOne of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations. With Bayesian probability interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics, being considered by one authority as; \"to the theory of probability what Pythagoras's theorem is to geometry.\"\n\n问题: What is Bayes theorem"

Most people learn via a combination of the above.  Let's assume the trainee learns via watching and doing.  The first step is safety.  The instructor must teach the basic stopping mechanism.  Once the trainee can stop this will provide a measure of confidence and instill with the trainee that they are in control and will be able to stop at any time.  The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.  Practicing this formation should be done many times until the trainee is comfortable stopping on steep slopes.  Once this effort is mastered, the trainee can move to the next steps in learning how to ski."

As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide (Easter season). The oldest tradition, which continues to be used in Central and Eastern Europe, is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs.\n\nAlthough eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth, in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus was resurrected. In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\"\n\nThis custom of the Easter egg, according to many sources, can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Eastern Europe and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches. Additionally, the widespread usage of Easter eggs, according to mediaevalist scholars, is due to the prohibition of eggs during Lent after which, on Easter, they have been blessed for the occasion.\n\nA modern custom in some places is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in coloured foil, hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about Easter eggs, tell me what they are, what they symbolize, and where they originated from?"

He is known colloquially as El Libertador, or the Liberator of America. Simón Bolívar was born in Caracas in the Captaincy General of Venezuela into a wealthy family of American-born Spaniards (criollo), but lost both parents as a child. Bolívar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bolívar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bolívar returned to Venezuela and proposed gaining Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles.

A government can decide what share of the national budget to spend on health care or education for its citizens. Through tariffs, taxes and subsidies, It can also influence under which conditions and with which countries trade is conducted. Similarly, economic policies guide the regulation of carbon emissions. These choices are often limited due to scarce resources (e.g., money, time, information). \n\nEconomists study the drivers and impacts of choices.

The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks. The Greeks staged a selection race for the Olympic marathon on 22 March 1896 (Gregorian) that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory Olympic Games marathon, Spyridon \"Spyros\" Louis, coming in fifth at a second race two weeks later). The winner of the first Olympic marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics was run on the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics. That men's marathon was won by Italian Stefano Baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-Olympics Athens Classic Marathon of 2014, when Felix Kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about the history of the marathon, who won the first official olympic marathon."

This map was later included in a literary and historical atlas of America by Bartholomew in 1884, with light blue areas marking regions that were not originally present on the map.\n\nToscanelli served as an inspiration for Columbus, who received a letter from him on June 25, 1474. The letter was sent to canon Fernam Martins in Lisbon, who consulted Toscanelli on behalf of King Alfonso V about the possibility of reaching India through a western route.\n\nThe map clearly shows that Columbus was both inspired and misguided by Toscanelli's plan, which underestimated the Earth's circumference. This miscalculation led Columbus to believe that he had reached Japan instead of a completely new and unfamiliar continent lying between Europe and Asia.\n\nToscanelli's proposed plan involved sailing west along the equator to reach India and the wealthy countries of East Asia. The map that Toscanelli enclosed, which is now lost, included the western fringes of Europe and Africa, as well as the eastern fringes of Asia, with the Atlantic Ocean in between. However, Toscanelli mistakenly believed that the distance was only one-third of the Earth's circumference, far less than the actual distance.\n\nIn a letter, Toscanelli writes, among other things:\n\nI have already spoken once before of a route across the sea to the land of spices, much shorter than that of the Portuguese across Guinea. That is why His Highness the King is now asking me for information on this subject, or rather for an explanation so clear that even people without any scientific background can understand that this path must exist. Although I know that it has its basis in the spherical shape of the earth, I have nevertheless, in order to make myself better understood and facilitate the project, decided to prove that such a route exists by means of a specially constructed sea chart. I am therefore sending his highness a map drawn by myself, on which I have marked the coasts and islands which can be used as points of departure when one undertakes such a journey and on this journey keeps a steady westerly course"

Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\n\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end."

Being able to exercise while feeling the sun on your back, hearing the birds chirp, and seeing people play around in the sand is a totally different experience than being stuck inside a dark building. Additionally, playing volleyball in the sand is way more difficult and a harder workout than playing on a court. In order to jump the same height or run after a shanked ball, you have to exert more energy. Since exercise is known to release endorphins, one could argue that more endorphins are released when playing beach volleyball over indoor. Overall, beach volleyball is more fun and a better workout than indoor volleyball."

Some products sold as dried fruit, like papaya, kiwifruit and pineapple, are most often candied fruit.\nDried fruits retain most of the nutritional value of fresh fruits.

        "content": "Competition is prevalent everywhere in our society. Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly.\nA common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work.\nCompetition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood.\nOften this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself.\nAlmost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. \"Forced\" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt \"caught on a treadmill,\" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals.\nTo prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important. If parents, teachers, or bosses know what you expect from yourself. they can better encourage, support, and challenge you."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Well one big reason is that eating among other people is a social activity. In any social activity, there are guidelines for behavior. Mostly these guidelines are intended to make the social activity pleasant or fun for all the people involved. \nFor table manners, the rules are noticeably different among different cultures. Still, there are some common themes across cultures, for what is considered polite manners while eating. One common theme is to ensure that every person at the meal gets to eat. You can see this in the American table manner rule that nobody should not start eating until every person has been served their meal. In Mexican culture, any child who is nearby an outdoor party should be offered some of the party food. Another common theme about manners is that you should enjoy the food and the company, and not appear to simply be gobbling down as much food as possible. There are a lot of negative words to describe behavior that looks like eating too much or too fast, to be considered polite: being piggish, wolfing your food, gobbling, scarfing. \nOne rule that helps enforce slow eating, in American table manners, is that you shouldn't butter a whole piece of bread before eating it. Instead, you should tear the bread into smaller pieces, and butter only the piece you will eat next. Breaking the bread in half is considered a minimum level of politeness. Also, it's considered polite to leave one bite of each dish on your plate. If you eat everything, it could signal that you were just hungry, and eating everything available! But if you leave one bite, it signals \"I liked it, but had enough\". Americans also slow down eating by using both their fork and their knife in their right hands. This means that whenever you need to cut your food, you have to put down your fork, pick it up in your left hand, and pick up your knife in your right hand to cut your food. Before taking the bite, you have to do the opposite: put down your knife, pick up your fork in your right hand, and take your bite. This slows down eating a lot. (This rule is in contrast to table manners for the English, who keep their fork in their left hand and their knife in their right hand). Also, when eating soup, it's polite to push the spoon away from you, after filling it. Wipe the bottom of the spoon on the far side of your bowl, before bringing the spoonful of soup to your mouth. If you eat soup this way, you avoid scooping spoonfuls directly into your mouth -- which again, could look like you are just wolfing down food as fast as possible, instead of enjoying each mouthful.\nThere are also some table manner rules that provide signals to the servers or the waitstaff, without requiring verbal communications. For example, if you put down your fork pointing at 4:00 (with the handle pointing to the lower right of your plate), then it communicates \"I'm still eating\". But if you put your fork down, pointing at 10:00 or 11:00, then it communicates \"I'm finished with this food\". Then your server can take away your plate without interrupting the group conversation, which again is an example of making the social activity more pleasant for the participants. \nOverall, the rules of table manners evolved to make the social experience of eating a meal together a pleasant experience for everyone."

Our sole prospect for defeating them rests in our ability to match their strength, to attain a power that rivals their own.” \n \nMasked Elder 2 (Female): “It’s not through technology that we find our strength, for true power comes from the divine within us. It is found in our ability to connect and draw from its boundless source. The Gods have granted us protection and with their aid, we shall vanquish our foes, as we always have.“ \n\nQuo: “The idea of divine strength is a fascinating one, but the Gods cannot protect us from the harsh realities upon us. Our duty, as protectors of our realm and the outer worlds, is to remain vigilant against the many threats that seek to undermine our safety. My oath remains resolute.’\n\nMasked elder3 leans in next to her and says: “Quo, I beg you, don’t do this..” With worry in his eyes."

        "content": "The first thing you must do is preheat your oven up as high as it will go. It takes longer than you think to heat your oven up all the way! You want to give your oven at least 30 minutes to preheat. If you have a pizza stone, make sure it’s inside the preheating oven.\nFor highend ovens, this can be up to 550 degrees F. For regular ovens, they are not going above 475 F. Pizza is traditionally cooked in 900 or 1,000 degree ovens. We can’t get our ovens at home quite that hot, but we want to get as close as we can. Figure out what your oven can do and crank up the heat.\nStart out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. Any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe.\nPlace your ball of dough in the center of your work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I like to leave a pretty healthy crust on the edges of my dough.\nContinue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across. Of course you can use a rolling pin if you want! (Use your hands to lift up the edges of the pizza when you are done to get more a lip for the crust.)\nAt this point, transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it’s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven.\nStretch and arrange the dough on the parchment paper. The dough shrinks a bit when you pick it up to transfer, just gently stretch it out again.\nDrizzle a bit of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps the toppings stay separate from the dough, helping it cook more evenly. It also tastes delicious, especially on your crust. \nOnce the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake.\nSome of my favorite pizza toppings:\nJust Cheese: Any will work: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola would be amazing.\nPepperoni\nMeat Lovers: Pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, ham, bacon\nHawaiian: Canadian bacon, pineapple\nMargherita: fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomatoes\nBBQ: Use barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, then rotisserie chicken, red onions, bacon\nVeggie pizza: spinach, tomato, corn, peppers, red onion, mushrooms\nBuffalo: Use Frank’s sauce instead of tomato sauce, then add rotisserie chicken, garlic, blue cheese, red onions\nOnce your pizza is in the oven, you need to cook it for about 8-12 minutes. This is of course going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to brown. If you don’t have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. Leave it in longer."

Below that are levels 2–4 organised by the English Football League, then the National League System from levels 5–10 administered by the FA, and thereafter feeder leagues run by relevant county FAs on an ad hoc basis.\n\nThe exact number of clubs varies from year to year as clubs join and leave leagues, merge, or fold altogether, but an estimated average of 15 clubs per division implies that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are members of a league in the English men's football league system.\n\nAs there are no official definitions of any level below 11, any references to the structure at level 12 and below should not be regarded as definitive.\n\nThe pyramid for women's football in England runs separately into ten tiers, and some England-based men's clubs play outside the English football league system."

As a result, many Indians were able to watch films by directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Sidney Lumet for the first time. This had a significant impact on Indian movie culture, as it exposed viewers to new and different styles of filmmaking."

The three reunion concerts were held on March 6, 7, and 8, 2009, with \"Fluffhead\" being the first song the band played onstage at the first show. Approximately 14,000 people attended the concerts over the course of three days, and the band made the shows available for free download on their LivePhish website for a limited time, in order to accommodate fans who were unable to attend. When the band decided to reunite, the members agreed to limit their touring schedule, and they have typically performed about 50 concerts a year since. Following the reunion weekend, Phish embarked on a summer tour which began in May with a concert at Fenway Park in Boston. The Fenway show was followed by a 25-date tour which included performances at the 2009 edition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee and a four date stand at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. At Bonnaroo, Phish was joined by Bruce Springsteen on guitar for three songs. Phish's fourteenth studio album, Joy, produced by Steve Lillywhite, was released September 8, 2009. In October, the band held Festival 8, their first multi-day festival event since Coventry in 2004, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. In March 2010, Anastasio inducted Genesis, one of his favorite bands, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the museum's annual ceremony in New York City.

Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."

        "content": "The telephone numbering plan of the USSR was a set of telephone area codes, numbers and dialling rules which operated in the Soviet Union until the 1990s. After the collapse of the USSR, many newly independent republics implemented their own numbering plans. However, many of the principles of the Soviet numbering plan still remain. Russia and Kazakhstan still retain the former Soviet international code +7.\n\nKey principles\nThe Soviet Union used a four-level open numbering plan. The long-distance prefix was 8.\n\na).One could call a local number without the code. Local numbers usually consisted of 5-7 digits, with seven-digit numbers only occurring in Moscow, Leningrad and Kyiv. If the internal number of the regional centre had less than seven digits, then its intercity code was supplemented with numbers (usually 2 for the administrative center, 6 for the second largest city).\nb).Within the same numbering area (most often within the state or region) the pattern was: 8 2X YYYYYY, where 2 replaced the three-digit area code.\nc).For calls to other areas, one had to first dial long-distance prefix 8, then, after the tone, the full code of the numbering area, which consisted of a three-digit code and zone additional digit(X), and then the local phone number.\nd).For international calls, one should dial 8 10 [country code]  [phone number]\nFor example: 8 10 1 212 XXXXXXX for a call to New York City.\nAlso: 8 10 359 2 XXXXXX for a call to the city of Sofia."

Once boiled you will need to mash the potatoes and add milk and butter if you want them to be more creamy.  Next steam carrots and peas and then add to the beef mixture.

The closest land outside the territory is in the US state of North Carolina, approximately 1,035 km (643 mi) to the northwest.\n\nBermuda is named after Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez, who discovered the archipelago in 1505. The islands have been permanently inhabited since 1612, and, forming part of British America, became a crown colony in 1684. The first African slaves arrived in 1616, but as the slave trade ceased by the end of the 17th century, the colony developed into a base for merchants, privateers, and the Royal Navy. More recently, tourism has been a significant contributor to Bermuda's economy. After World War II the territory became an offshore financial centre and tax haven.\n\nAs of 2019, Bermuda had a population of around 64,000 people, making it the second-most populous of the British overseas territories, after the Cayman Islands. Black Bermudians, primarily descended from African slaves, make up almost 60% of the population, while White Bermudians, primarily of British, Irish, and Portuguese descent, account for more than 30%.\n\n问题: Based on the above passage classify Bermudians based on their descent along with respective percentages in a bracket.

There are a few styles, however, that are historically and culturally significant. They are also the most commonly found in restaurants as well as private events.\n\nEastern style\nEastern-style barbecue is a whole-hog style of barbecue, often said to use \"every part of the hog except the squeal\". Eastern-style sauce is vinegar and pepper-based, with no tomato whatsoever. Eastern sauce is mostly used as a seasoning after the cook (although it can also be used as a mop sauce while the hog is cooking). The coleslaw served with eastern-style uses mayonnaise (or whipped salad dressing) almost universally.\n\nLexington style\nLexington style barbecue (also called Piedmont or Western style) uses a red sauce, or \"dip\", made from vinegar, tomatoes, and usually red pepper flakes, along with other spices that vary from recipe to recipe.  It is most common in the Piedmont and western areas of the state. This style uses only the pork shoulder section of the pig. As with other styles of barbecue, the recipes vary widely, and can include many different ingredients, and range from slightly sweet to hot and spicy. The sauce also serves as the seasoning base for \"red slaw\" (also called \"barbecue slaw\"), which is coleslaw made by using Lexington-style barbecue sauce in place of mayonnaise. Hushpuppies are usually consumed with pork shoulder and slaw.\n\nPork ribs\nPork ribs are a common alternative to the two most common types of North Carolina barbecue and a variety of festivals and competitions are held annually. Baby back ribs, sometimes called top loin ribs, are short, succulent, well-marbled ribs cut from the center section of the loin. Spare ribs come from lower down the rib cage (from the sides and upper belly of the pig). They are not quite as tender as baby backs, but are thicker, longer, and more flavorful.\n\n问题: What types of BBQ can you get in North Carolina?"

The Little Engine is an undersized locomotive that is called upon to pull rail cars full of good things for the boys and girls that live on the other side of the mountain.  Several other locomotives, appearing newer, stronger or more mature than the Little Engine all make excuses for why they will not help take the train cars over the mountain.\n\nThe Little Engine gladly takes on the task when called upon.  When starting to pull the heavy rail cars, The Little Engine strains with all its might and begins to say, \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.\"  When climbing the mountain, it doesn't look like the Little Engine has the power to get over the peak.  The Little Engine puffs, \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.\"  Finally The Little Engine reaches the top, comes over the crest and on the way down says, \"I though I could, I thought I could, I thought I could.\""

        "content": "Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including biomolecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.[ The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.\n\nMolecular biology was first described as an approach focused on the underpinnings of biological phenomena - uncovering the structures of biological molecules as well as their interactions, and how these interactions explain observations of classical biology.\n\nIn 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury. In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine."

It was pretty warm.  As I peeked into the crisp new air, I saw ferns, spiders, and buzzing flies surrounding me.  But the thing that caught my attention most of all was the bright blue sky.  I wondered what was out there and if I would ever get to see it.  I had just met this world and wanted to learn so much more.  But I was only 3 inches tall and couldn't see much of anything.  So I waited.\n\nAs I got taller, the days began to feel shorter.  My favorite part of the day was feeling the wind blow through my newly acquired canopy of needles.  It wasn't much to look at, but I was proud.  I'd often stare at the giant trees around me.  How I yearned to be one of the tall redwoods.  They were kings of the forest; nothing stood taller.  I wanted to see what they could see from way up there.  One day I'll be one of them.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks turned into years, and it all felt so rushed that I could hardly keep track of the changing world around me.  I had grown tall enough to see through a clearing in the upper canopy.  Beyond our patch of trees was a mountain of countless others.  Looking out into the endless distance, I began to feel small.  What a strange feeling.  One cloudy day, I saw a lightning bolt strike a hilltop.  Soon enough, bright orange flames erupted across the horizon.  What a peculiar sight.  What began as a curiosity soon became terror as the fire rushed closer to my area of the woods.  I could feel the warm wind on my face as the fire grew more prominent.  Mercifully, the dark clouds hanging overhead opened up to a torrential downpour.  Cold pelting raindrops replaced the warm breeze, night fell over the mountain, and the forest breathed a sigh of relief.  \n\nI awoke to a strange sight when the sun returned the next day.  What was once hundreds of proud redwoods was now a deep black scar on the mountain.  That would be me one day."

He served two terms as Governor of Massachusetts and several months as Acting Governor following the death in 1825 of William Eustis. He served for 15 years as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, all the while running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for governor. He finally won the 1839 election, acquiring exactly the number of votes required for a majority win over Edward Everett. After losing the 1840 and 1841 elections, he was elected in a narrow victory in 1842.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democratic Party was highly factionalized, which contributed to Morton's long string of defeats. His brief periods of ascendancy, however, resulted in no substantive Democratic-supported reforms, since the dominant Whigs reversed most of the changes enacted during his terms. An opponent of the extension of slavery, he split with longtime friend John C. Calhoun over that issue, and eventually left the party for the Free Soil movement. He was considered by Martin Van Buren as a potential vice presidential running mate in 1848.\n\n问题: Given a reference text about Marcus Morton, tell me what year he was born and why he let the Democratic Party."

It competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The team has played its home matches in the 62,850-capacity Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since April 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.\n\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with the Latin motto Audere est Facere (\"to dare is to do\"). The club has traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898–99 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross, Enfield. After its inception, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup. They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies.

        "content": "One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a “good” one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato’s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one’s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author’s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one’s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest “good”, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner — that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn’t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one’s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, “Similarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.” (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, “wealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.” (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one’s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it’s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, “Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.” (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates’ beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth’s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which “goodness” lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one’s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one’s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, “a good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.” (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, “The highest good, on the other hand, must be something final” (Aristotle. Bk. 1 pg. 14) Stating that while there are different branches of a good life, virtuous behavior is not a constant and therefore you cannot give a description to their life as a whole until it’s end. Socrates’ arguments on the length of goodness are rather naive, seeing as people change over time, only with the entire information of their lives can one make a claim as to whether or not they had a good life.\nIn summary, the two different views on how we are to live a good life together provide insight and theory into the subject but neither provides a complete instruction on doing so. Socrates, as written down by Plato, describes his own life which he\nDahlke 5\n\nconsiders to be a virtuous one and Aristotle provides a philosophical theory behind how to live in a virtuous way with the end goal of happiness or in other words a good life. The closest we can get to understanding how to live a good life is by understanding what makes up a good life, and even this is subjective. One person’s views on what a virtuous life means can differ greatly from the next depending on where they lived, their religious beliefs, or social status. These variances result in many different guides to and definitions of a good life. Within all the different viewpoints, a concept introduced in Nicomachean Ethics that can be widely accepted is that within someone’s life there is a median point between each of their emotions, actions and characteristics that create virtue and lead towards a good life."

        "content": "背景: Modern scratching techniques were made possible by the invention of direct-drive turntables, which led to the emergence of turntablism. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for scratching since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear and tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.\n\nIn the 1970s, hip hop musicians and club DJs began to use this specialized turntable equipment to move the record back and forth, creating percussive sounds and effects–\"scratching\"–to entertain their dance floor audiences. Whereas the 1940s–1960s radio DJs had used back-cueing while listening to the sounds through their headphones, without the audience hearing, with scratching, the DJ intentionally lets the audience hear the sounds that are being created by manipulating the record on the turntable, by directing the output from the turntable to a sound reinforcement system so that the audience can hear the sounds. Scratching was developed by early hip hop DJs from New York City such as Grand Wizzard Theodore, who described scratching as, \"nothing but the back-cueing that you hear in your ear before you push it [the recorded sound] out to the crowd.\" He developed the technique when experimenting with the Technics SL-1200, a direct-drive turntable released by Matsushita in 1972 when he found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Afrika Bambaataa made a similar discovery with the SL-1200 in the 1970s. The Technics SL-1200 went on to become the most widely used turntable for the next several decades.\n\nJamaican-born DJ Kool Herc, who immigrated to New York City, influenced the early development of scratching. Kool Herc developed break-beat DJing, where the breaks of funk songs—being the most danceable part, often featuring percussion—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. He was influenced by Jamaican dub music, and developed his turntable techniques using the Technics SL-1100, released in 1971, due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity.\n\nAlthough previous artists such as writer and poet William S. Burroughs had experimented with the idea of manipulating a reel-to-reel tape manually to make sounds, as with his 1950s recording, \"Sound Piece\"), vinyl scratching as an element of hip hop pioneered the idea of making the sound an integral and rhythmic part of music instead of an uncontrolled noise. Scratching is related to \"scrubbing\" (in terms of audio editing and production) when the reels of an open reel-to-reel tape deck (typically 1/4 inch magnetic audiotape) are gently rotated back and forth while the playback head is live and amplified, to isolate a specific spot on the tape where an editing \"cut\" is to be made. In the 2010s, both scratching and scrubbing can be done on digital audio workstations (DAWs) which are equipped for these techniques.\n\n\nWhere It All Started\n\nDJ Sample of the song \"Where it All Started\"\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\nChristian Marclay was one of the earliest musicians to scratch outside hip hop. In the mid-1970s, Marclay used gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages. He developed his turntable sounds independently of hip hop DJs. Although he is little-known to mainstream audiences, Marclay has been described as \"the most influential turntable figure outside hip hop\" and the \"unwitting inventor of turntablism.\"\n\nIn 1981 Grandmaster Flash released the song \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\" which is notable for its use of many DJ scratching techniques. It was the first commercial recording produced entirely using turntables. In 1982, Malcolm McLaren & the World's Famous Supreme Team released a single \"Buffalo Gals\", juxtaposing extensive scratching with calls from square dancing, and, in 1983, the EP, D'ya Like Scratchin'?, which is entirely focused on scratching. Another 1983 release to prominently feature scratching is Herbie Hancock's Grammy Award-winning single \"Rockit\". This song was also performed live at the 1984 Grammy Awards, and in the documentary film Scratch, the performance is cited by many 1980s-era DJs as their first exposure to scratching. The Street Sounds Electro compilation series which started in 1983 is also notable for early examples of scratching. Also, a notable piece was \"For A Few Dollars More\" by Bill Laswell-Michael Beinhorn band Material, released on 12\" single in Japan and containing scratch performed by Grand Mixer DXT, another pioneer of scratching.\n\n问题: Who invented scratching ?"

        "content": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."

Forty-nine catalog pages with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities. In 2014, a project was started to implement the capabilities from the ANT catalog as open-source hardware and software.\n\nBackground\nThe Tailored Access Operations unit has existed since the late 90s. Its mission is to collect intelligence on foreign targets of the United States by hacking into computers and telecommunication networks.\n\nIn 2012, Edward Snowden organized a CryptoParty together with Runa Sandvik, a former colleague of Jacob Appelbaum at The Tor Project. In June 2013, Snowden took internal NSA documents which he shared with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, resulting in the global surveillance disclosures. It has been speculated for years before that capabilities like those in the ANT catalog existed.\n\nPublication\nJacob Appelbaum co-authored the English publication in Der Spiegel with Christian Stöcker  and Judith Horchert, which was publicized on 29 December 2013. The related English publication on the same day about the TAO by Der Spiegel was also authored by the same people, and including Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler and Holger Stark. On December 30, Appelbaum gave a lecture about \"the militarization of the Internet\" at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. At the end of his talk, he encouraged NSA employees to leak more documents.\n\nApple denied the allegations that it collaborated on the development of DROPOUTJEEP in a statement to journalist Arik Hesseldahl from All Things Digital (part of the Wall Street Journal's Digital Network). The Verge questioned how the program developed in later years, since the document was composed in the early period of the iPhone and smartphones in general. Dell denied collaborating with any government in general, including the US government. John Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer of Cisco stated that they were \"deeply concerned and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine if we need to address any new issues.\" Juniper stated that they were working actively to address any possible exploit paths. Huawei stated they would take appropriate audits to determine if any compromise had taken place and would communicate if that had taken place. NSA declined to comment on the publication by Der Spiegel.\n\nSource\nThe source who leaked the ANT catalog to the press is unknown as of 2023.\n\nAuthor James Bamford, who is specialized in the United States intelligence agencies, noted in a commentary article published by Reuters that Appelbaum has not identified the source who leaked the ANT catalog to him, which led people to mistakenly assume it was Edward Snowden. Bamford got unrestricted access to the documents cache from Edward Snowden and could not find any references to the ANT catalog using automated search tools, thereby concluding that the documents were not leaked by him. Security expert Bruce Schneier has stated on his blog that he also believes the ANT catalog did not come from Snowden, but from a second leaker. Officials at the NSA did not believe that the web crawler used by Snowden touched the ANT catalog and started looking for other people who could have leaked the catalog.\n\nContent\nThe published catalog pages were written between 2008 and 2009. The price of the items ranged from free up to $250,000.\n\nCapabilities in the ANT catalog \nPage\tCode name\tDescription\tUnit price in US$\nNSA CANDYGRAM.jpg\tCANDYGRAM\tTripwire device that emulates a GSM cellphone tower.\t40,000\nNSA COTTONMOUTH-I.jpg\tCOTTONMOUTH-I\tFamily of modified USB and Ethernet connectors that can be used to install Trojan horse software and work as wireless bridges, providing covert remote access to the target machine.

Most of the surveillance tools can be recreated with off-the-shelf or open-source hardware and software. Thus far, the NSA Playset consists of fourteen items, for which the code and instructions can be found online on the project's homepage. After the initial leak, Michael Ossman, the founder of Great Scott Gadgets, gave a shout out to other security researchers to start working on the tools mentioned in the catalog and to recreate them. The name NSA Playset came originally from Dean Pierce, who is also a contributor (TWILIGHTVEGETABLE(GSM)) to the NSA Playset. Anyone is invited to join and contribute their own device. The requisites for an addition to the NSA Playset is a similar or already existing NSA ANT project, ease of use and a silly name (based on the original tool's name if possible). The silly name requisite is a rule that Michael Ossman himself came up with and an example is given on the project's website: \"For example, if your project is similar to FOXACID, maybe you could call it COYOTEMETH.\" The ease of use part stems also from the NSA Playset's motto: \"If a 10 year old can't do it, it doesn't count!\"\n\nName\tDescription\nTWILIGHTVEGETABLE\ta boot image for GSM communication monitoring.\nLEVITICUS\ta hand held GSM frequency analyzer disguised as a Motorola phone; named after GENESIS.\nDRIZZLECHAIR\ta hard drive with all the needed tools to crack A5/1 including the rainbow tables.\nPORCUPINEMASQUERADE\ta passive Wi-Fi reconnaissance drone.\nKEYSWEEPER\ta keylogger in form of a USB wall charger, that wirelessly and passively sniffs, decrypts, logs and reports back (over GSM).\nSLOTSCREAMER\ta PCI hardware implant, which can access memory and IO.\nADAPTERNOODLE\ta USB exploitation device.\nCHUKWAGON\tuses a pin on a computer's VGA port to attack via the I²C bus accessing the computer's operating system.\nTURNIPSCHOOL\ta hardware implant concealed in a USB cable which provides short range radio frequency communication capability to software running on the host computer.\nBLINKERCOUGH\ta hardware implant that is embedded in a VGA cable which allows data exfiltration.\nSAVIORBURST\ta hardware implant exploiting the JTAG interface for software application persistence; named after GODSURGE.

He was a descendant of the principal sachems of the Mohegans, Pequots, and Narragansetts. Owaneco presided over the village known as Montonesuck. Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch.\n\nIn 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them. Owaneco died shortly after this marriage, and Uncas had to submit to Tatobem's authority. Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem.\n\nOwaneco's alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus. His failed challenges resulted in Uncas having little land and few followers, but Uncas saw that the newly arriving Puritan colonists, though few in number, had better weapons and much courage, so he started to develop a new strategy and alliance to work towards his ultimate goal of Grand Sachem.\n\n问题: Given this paragraph about Chief Uncas, who was he?"

The organization was established mainly to counter the ongoing social reform movements led by protagonists such as Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Henry Derozio. More specifically, the impetus of forming the organization came from a new law enacted by the colonial British rule which banned the barbaric practice of burning widows alive (sati) in the country; the focus of the new association was to repel the law which was seen as an intrusion by the British into the religious affairs of the indigenous people by some sections of the Hindu community. The Dharma Sabha filed an appeal in the Privy Council against the ban on Sati by Lord William Bentinck as, according to them, it went against the assurance given by George III of non-interference in Hindu religious affairs; however, their appeal was rejected and the ban on Sati was upheld in 1832. It published a newspaper called Samachar Chandrika.\n\nThe Dharma Sabha campaigned against the Hindu Widow Remarriage Act, 1856 and submitted a petition against the proposal with nearly four times more signatures than the one submitted for it by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. However  Lord Dalhousie personally finalized the bill despite the opposition and it being considered a flagrant breach of Hindu customs as prevalent then, and it was passed by Lord Canning.\n\nThe organization soon morphed into a 'society in defense of Hindu way of life or culture'.[\n\n问题: What is Dharma Sabha"

        "content": "背景: The Federal Reserve System (often shortened to the Federal Reserve, or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises.[list 1] Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCongress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially-appointed board of governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately-owned commercial banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy. It consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time—the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms. There are also various advisory councils.[list 2] It has a structure unique among central banks, and is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used.\n\nThe federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, and it receives all the system's annual profits, after dividends on member banks' capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and 2020 earnings were approximately $88.6 billion with remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $86.9 billion. Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself \"an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.\"\n\n问题: Based on the reference text, provide a concise overview of the main objectives of the Federal Reserve"

From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. \nResearchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of. \nIf you want to live a long and healthy life, eat more plants, exercise, get some sleep and spend time with your friends and family."

        "content": "Frying shrimp is very easy, and requires simple equipment and ingredients. \n\nUse shrimp that is U-15 or less.  Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it’s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.  Promptly after the shrimp is out of the pan, sprinkle salt on the shrimp and serve."

This philosophy heavily influenced the drafting of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"\n\n问题: Based on the reference text, how did the United States implement separation of powers?"

        "content": "背景: In the Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Michael Gaenzle writes: \"One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt several thousand years earlier\", which was confirmed a few years later by archeological evidence. ... \"Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years.\"\n\nSourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages until being replaced by barm from the beer brewing process, and after 1871 by purpose-cultured yeast.\n\nBread made from 100% rye flour, popular in the northern half of Europe, is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a leavening agent for rye bread, as rye does not contain enough gluten. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the starch in the flour as well as other carbohydrates known as pentosans; however, rye amylase is active at substantially higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during baking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. In the southern part of Europe, where panettone is still made with sourdough as leavening, sourdough has become less common in the 20th century; it has been replaced by the faster-growing baker's yeast, sometimes supplemented with longer fermentation rests to allow for some bacterial activity to build flavor. Sourdough fermentation re-emerged as a major fermentation process in bread production during the 2010s, although it is commonly used in conjunction with baker's yeast as leavening agent.\n\nFrench bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture of San Francisco today. (The nickname remains in \"Sourdough Sam\", the mascot of the San Francisco 49ers.) Sourdough has long been associated with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make bread with commercial yeast or baking soda. The \"celebrated\" San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced sourness, and indeed the strain of Lactobacillus in sourdough starters is named Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis (previously Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis), alongside the sourdough yeast Kasachstania humilis (previously Candida milleri) found in the same cultures.\n\nThe sourdough tradition was carried into Department of Alaska in the United States and the Yukon territory in Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Conventional leavenings such as yeast and baking soda were much less reliable in the conditions faced by the prospectors. Experienced miners and other settlers frequently carried a pouch of starter either around their neck or on a belt; these were fiercely guarded to keep from freezing. However, freezing does not kill a sourdough starter; excessive heat does. Old hands came to be called \"sourdoughs\", a term that is still applied to any Alaskan or Klondike old-timer. The significance of the nickname's association with Yukon culture was immortalized in the writings of Robert Service, particularly his collection of \"Songs of a Sourdough\".[citation needed]\n\nIn English-speaking countries, where wheat-based breads predominate, sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers and, more recently, in industrial bakeries. In countries where there is no legal definition of sourdough bread, the dough for some products named or marketed as such is leavened using baker's yeast or chemical raising agents as well as, or instead of, a live sourdough starter culture. The Real Bread Campaign calls these products sourfaux.\n\nManufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially-made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.\n\n问题: Extract the different kinds of leavening agents mentioned in this passage. Separate them with a comma."

By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics\n\n问题: Given these paragraphs about Multiomics, what is single-cell multiomics?"

By a treaty with William Penn in 1726, various tribes either rented or gave up their land on both sides of Brandywine Creek. Nemacolin likely grew up near Shamokin, Pennsylvania, a village near the Susquehanna River to which the Delaware had retreated when faced with disease and colonization of their traditional lands by white settlers. His family grew to know trader Thomas Cresap, and moved south and west with the Cresap family, likely after a controversy between groups of settlers aligned with the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania known as Cresap's War.\n\
